SEEKERS
SEEKERS
It began as a rumor on Shinju’s datasphere: a message forwarded from comlog to comlog, a restricted-access story in someone’s 
halo. Some guys at the University of Manaheim had just developed a system to predict the emergence of QAZs. It was an unverified 
and unfiltered announcement that upended the Sāchā community, Shinju’s xenotechnology seekers. Some of them claimed it would 
mark the end of their trade and their life’s calling. Other people anticipated the advent of a golden age. And many grieved that the 
art in their business would be lost. 
According to those rumors, this technology had already been seized by PanOceania and the Greater Independent Japan as a result 
of an operation conducted against a research outpost in the Barrenlands of the Ryakudatsu. And the rest of the big powers were 
just biding their time to determine if it really worked before kicking off their own research. So, in the meantime, spy remotes fly 
across the wastelands looking for any expeditions that may have furtively ventured out in search of a QAZ in an attempt to ascertain 
if any have been successful, and then send a raiding team to intercept these expeditions on their return journey and capture any 
artifacts they may have found.
Thus, many front companies—subsidiaries of corporations that work closely with intelligence services, either out of mutual interest 
or because they are being coerced into doing so in order to prevent some dirty secrets from coming to light—send their expeditions 
into the Barrenlands under the pretense of carrying out research. In actuality, these teams are made up of elite operatives devoid of 
patches, or any ID, and their sole mission is to get their hands on disruptive xenotechnology by any means necessary, regardless of 
international law, and no matter the cost.
Never did the Barrenlands see so much activity and never had the servers of Bureau Aegis’ surveillance systems on Shinju faced 
this many overwhelming cyberattacks aimed at masking their illegal incursions into the Ryakudatsu. At present, all powers are 
acting as seekers. Some use cutting-edge tech as their competitive advantage, while others stalk their prey and descend on them 
like raptors. But these prey have sharp claws and fangs too, and they are ready to fight back to protect the items they have worked 
so hard to obtain.
Tensions are sure to escalate, and a secret conflict will be fought far from the sight of the rest of the Sphere, one that could tip the 
balance of power if any player were to find a strategic xenoartifact. And that requires more than just QAZ-locating technology. It 
requires people who know how to get in and out of those hellish environments, and how to survive all the dangers they hold within. 
It requires having a Sāchā, a crucial asset for all powers acting as seekers. So, these times offer plenty of opportunities for these 
adventurers, a chance to amass riches and glory, or a chance to die the most gruesome death imaginable, because the QAZs offer 
no middle ground.

ITS: BASIC RULES
Infinity Tournament System (ITS) is Infinity’s official system for organized play and features an International Ranking to keep track of each player’s score.
There are a number of ways to participate in ITS, but all ITS events share the basic rules set forth in this document.
For an event to be officially sanctioned and its results recorded onto the International Ranking, it must comply with all applicable rules.
The ITS rules are divided into those pertaining to the participants and those pertaining to the tournament organizers. The purpose of these rules is to facilitate 
the organization of and participation in Infinity tournaments in a way that allows all members of the player community to be a part of a worldwide system with 
common ground rules that are fair to all.
EVENT PARTICIPANTS
In order to take part in an official ITS event, players are required 
to bring everything they need to play, including:
	
^ Miniatures.
	
^ Tape measure.
	
^ Templates and markers.
	
^ Dice.
	
^ Operations Deck.
	
^ Army lists.
Participation in official Infinity events implies knowledge and 
acceptance of all rules in this document as well as any rules set 
forth by the event Organizer.
SPORTSMANSHIP
All participants in an event, whether Organizers, Players, or 
guests, are expected to conduct themselves in a friendly and 
considerate manner at all times. If a participant disrupts the 
good atmosphere of an event, the Organizer may penalize them 
or altogether remove them from play.
Minimum player etiquette includes giving the opponent time 
to clearly see the results on your dice before picking them 
up, sharing with the opponent all open information from your 
army list and clarifying it as often as requested, waiting for the 
opponent to declare ARO whenever you spend an Order, etc
 
REMEMBER
Infinity is first and foremost a game and events should be 
fun for everyone involved.
MINIATURES
All miniatures used by the players must be from Corvus Belli’s 
official Infinity range and must be assembled—with at least 
their main components—and based, using the base supplied 
with the figure or another of the same size.
Each figure must represent faithfully the Trooper it stands for, 
including its equipment and weapon options. If a player does not 
have the official miniature, then at the tournament organizer’s 
discretion, they can use a different Corvus Belli miniature as a 
stand-in, but they must clearly inform their opponent of what 
that figure represents.
LINE OF FIRE (LOF)
For the sake of clarity and agility, every figure in play must 
display its 180º Line of Fire arc by means of distinct painted 
markings on its base or the appropriate markers (such as 
Corvus Belli’s new bases, Customeeple’s Line of Sight Markers 
or Micro Art Studio’s Infinity Arc Markers).
PAINTING
Unless otherwise specified by the rules of the event, figures 
do not need to be painted. But it is recommended to enjoy the 
experience of hobby to the maximum.
5
PROXIES
Under no circumstances can miniatures from other brands or 
manufacturers be used as proxies. The use of other Corvus 
Belli miniatures is allowed; however, players must inform their 
adversary which Trooper is being represented. The figure must 
use the same size base as the Trooper being represented.
CONVERTED FIGURES
Use of converted figures is allowed, and in fact encouraged, as 
long as most or all the figure is composed of parts from Corvus 
Belli miniatures and the figure accurately represents the unit 
and weapon option it stands for. The figure must use the same 
size base as the Trooper being represented.
ARMY LISTS
Army Lists must conform to the rules laid out in the Infinity 
rulebooks and the special rules of the event, if there are any.
All participating Players must use the Infinity Army web app or 
mobile app (available for free on the Infinity website) to create 
and check their Army Lists. Should there be a discrepancy, 
the information available on the official Infinity website takes 
precedence.
MERCENARIES
Mercenary Troops, such as the Yuan Yuan or Avicenna, can be 
fielded only as part of the Generic or Sectorial Armies in which 
they are available.
RULES
The Official Game Rules and Official Army Lists are those 
published by Corvus Belli on the official Infinity website (www.
infinitytheuniverse.com/) and on the official Infinity Army 
builder (www. infinitytheuniverse.com/army).
All game rules, FAQs, Infinity Wiki, Rules Errata, and army lists 
published up to one week before the date of an event apply to 
that event.
EVENT ORGANIZERS
The Event Organizer is the person, store, or club that will 
organize and manage the event.
Organizers are expected to be an example of good conduct, 
whether they are participating in the event as players or not.
DUTIES OF THE ORGANIZER
The Organizer is responsible for:
	
^ Ensuring that the rules of the event and the game rules 
are observed.
	
^ Informing Corvus Belli of the results of the event, as 
indicated in the rules for that type of event.
	
^ Ensuring all participants are registered in the ITS before 
the event takes place. Players can register using the form 
available at:  https://sphere.corvusbelli.com/
	
^ Providing an adequate venue for the event, as well as 
anything else required to play (tables, scenery, etc.).
	
^ Establishing the times and duration of each game.
REFEREES
During events, Referees are the ultimate authority in matters 
of game rules, which is why they are expected to make fair 
rulings and to devote all the time necessary to solving the 
players’ doubts. To make the Referee’s job easier, players are 
encouraged to try to solve their disputes in a friendly manner, 
and only turn to the Referee if an agreement cannot be reached. 
Once requested, the Referee’s rulings are final.
In the same way, the Referee can establish the sanction he 
considers appropriate if a player doesn’t follow the rules 
determined by the Organizer.
The Referee and the Organizer of the event will often be the 
same person. If they are not, the Organizer is bound by the 
rulings of the Referee like any other participant, both in matters 
of game rules and conflict resolution.
To prevent conflicts of interest, it is advisable—but not 
mandatory—for the Referee to abstain from participating in the 
event as a player.
6
RANKINGS
Every Official ITS event counts towards Infinity Player Rankings.
Rankings rate players according to their performance in 
officially sanctioned events, as indicated by their ITS Rating.
Players start the season with an ITS Rating of 1000. Their 
performance in each Official ITS event they take part in modifies 
that Rating, depending on whether the result was better or 
worse than expected as predicted by an Elo rating system.
The amount by which the ITS Rating of a player varies with each 
event depends on the event’s K factor, as follows:
TOURNAMENT 
TYPE
400/350-TIER
300/250-TIER
200/150-TIER
Tournament 
or league
K+15%
K=32
K-15%
Special events, such as the Interplanetario Tournament, might 
have different K factors
At the end of the season, the winner of the Ranking will receive 
the following prizes:
	
^ Unlocking the Quantronic Crown achievement in the 
player’s profile.
REGIONAL RANKINGS 
There are a total of three separate Rankings: the Spanish 
Ranking, the U.S. Ranking and the International Ranking. 
Players that do not participate in the Spanish or the U.S. ranking 
automatically participate in the International Ranking.
At the end of the season, the winners of each of the three 
Regional Rankings will receive the following prizes:
	
^ A guaranteed seat in the next season Interplanetario 
Tournament.
	
^ The current ITS Season exclusive miniature, painted by 
the Corvus Belli team.
	
^ An official current ITS Season trophy.
7
BASIC RULES
As Official Events, all Tournaments must comply with the Basic 
Rules of ITS. In case of discrepancy between these rules and the 
Basic Rules, this document takes precedence.
FORMAT OF THE EVENT
This is the basic ITS format for tournaments. This format 
pits 4 or more players in one-to-one games over 3 or more 
Tournament Rounds.
TOURNAMENT CONTROL SHEET
At the start of the event, each player receives a Tournament 
Control Sheet. Players must write down their name, ITS PIN and 
faction or sectorial army on their sheets.
During the tournament, players are required to use their 
sheet to write down the score of their game at the end of each 
Tournament Round. They must also use their sheet to make note 
of their Private Information so that it can be validated by their 
opponents or by the Referee when needed.
NUMBER 
OF TOURNAMENT ROUNDS
The number of Tournament Rounds per tournament depends on 
the number of players, as shown in this table:
PLAYERS
TOURNAMENT ROUNDS
4-8
3
9-16
4
17+
5
Treat this table as a guideline. The Organizer decides the 
number of Tournament Rounds a tournament will have, but 
there must never be fewer than 3. 
KEEPING SCORE
Ranking during a tournament is determined by the player’s 
Tournament Points score.
After each Round, players are awarded Tournament Points 
depending on their game’s outcome. The decisiveness of a 
player’s victory and its associated Tournament Points reward is 
measured by the difference in Objective Points scored by each 
player, as per this table:
OUTCOME
TOURNAMENT 
POINTS
Victory
4
Earning more Objective Points than 
the opponent.
Tie
2
Earning as many Objective Points as 
the opponent.
Defeat
0
Earning fewer Objective Points than 
the opponent.
Offensive 
Bonus
+1
Earning 5 or more Objective Points. 
This Tournament Point is added to 
the obtained result.
Defensive 
Bonus
+1
Losing by 2 or less Objective Points. 
This Tournament Point is added to 
the obtained result
EXAMPLE 1

Player A scored 4 Objective Points during this Tournament 
Round, while her opponent, Player B, scored 1 Objective 
Points. The outcome of the game was a Victory for Player 
A (4 Tournament Points) and a Defeat for Player B (0 
Tournament Points).
EXAMPLE 2

Player A earned 7 Objective Points and Player B earned 6 
Objective Points. Player A is the winner of this match and 
will obtain 4 Tournament Points for the Victory + 1 for the 
Offensive Bonus = 5 Tournament Points. Player B obtains 
nothing for the Defeat, but adds 2 Tournament Points for the 
Offensive Bonus and the Defensive Bonus.

If both players tie on Tournament Points, determine the winner 
by comparing each player’s Objective Points. If there is still a tie, 
break it by comparing each player’s Victory Points, that is, their 
Surviving Army Points.
TOURNAMENT RULES
8
FINAL SCORES
Once the last Tournament Round has finished, it is the duty 
of the Organizer to rank the players according to their total 
Tournament Points scores.
The winner of the tournament is the player who ranked first, 
that is, the one with the highest Tournament Points score.
If two or more players are tied for the same position, they are 
ranked according to their total Objective Points.
If both their Tournament Points and Objective Points scores are 
equal, players are ranked according to their total Victory Points. 
If this fails to break the tie, players are ranked according to the 
total of the Objective Points achieved by their opponents in the 
tournament.
PAIRINGS
Pairings for the first Tournament Round are assigned at 
random.
From the second Tournament Round on, a Swiss system is used. 
Players are ranked according to their Tournament Points scores, 
and ties are broken by comparing total Objective Point scores. If 
the tie persists, compare the players’ total Victory Points and, if 
this fails to break the tie, the total Objective Points achieved by 
their previous opponents in the tournament. Once all players are 
ranked, opponents are assigned in descending order of ranking 
(first against second, third against fourth, etc.).
ODD NUMBER 
OF PLAYERS (BYES)
If the number of players in the tournament is not even, each 
Tournament Round one of the players will have to wait for the 
next Tournament Round to play; that player is said to be “given 
a bye”. A player who takes a bye is awarded a Victory (worth 4 
Tournament Points), 0 Objective Points and 0 Victory Points for 
that Round. 
The Organizer must make sure that a single player is never 
given more than one bye during a tournament. 
For the first Tournament Round, the player given a bye is 
determined at random. In subsequent Tournament Rounds, the 
player with the lowest ranking takes a bye, unless that player 
had already taken a bye in one of the previous Tournament 
Rounds. In that case, the player with the next lowest ranking 
who had not previously taken a bye is given the bye. 
When players take a bye, they must make a note of it in their 
Tournament Control Sheet. Once the last Tournament Round 
ends, players who were given a bye follow these steps:
	
^ Add up all Objective Points the player earned during the 
tournament.  
	
^ Multiply the result by the number of Tournament Rounds 
of the tournament. 
	
^ Divide the result by the number of Tournament Rounds 
played (one less than the total Tournament Rounds of the 
tournament) and then round up.  
	
^ The end result is their final Objective Points score. In 
the event of a tie, repeat the process with the player’s 
Victory Points.
ARMY LISTS
Each player is obligated to submits one or two Army Lists to the 
CorvuSphere, both from a single Generic or Sectorial Army. 
Lists must observe all rules for army building set forth in the 
Infinity rulebooks. 
Each player must bring two printed copies of each of their 
Complete Army Lists – the lists that contain all of the army’s 
information, Open and Private – and give one to the Organizer 
before the first Tournament Round begins. Additionally, every 
player must carry a printed copy of each Courtesy Army List. 
This version contains only the list’s Open Information so it can 
be shown to his adversaries upon request , but always after 
finishing the Deployment Phase. 
The Tournament Organizer can require players turn in their 
Army Lists in advance to check their validity. 
The only officially sanctioned Army List management tool 
for ITS play is Infinity Army, available for free on the Infinity 
website. 
9
CHOOSING AN 
ARMY LIST TO USE 
Players choose which of their Army Lists to use in a Tournament 
Round at the beginning of that Round, after they have been 
informed of who their opponent is, what their Classified 
Objectives are, what faction they face, and which table they will 
be using. 
TOURNAMENT TIERS 
Tournament Tiers determine the number of Army Points players 
can use to build their armies. 
	
^ 400/350-Tier: 400 Army Points and 8 SWC, or 350 Army 
Points and 7 SWC. 
	
^ 300/250-Tier: 300 Army Points and 6 SWC, or 250 Army 
Points and 5 SWC. 
	
^ 200/150-Tier: 200 Army Points and 4 SWC, or 150 Army 
Points and 3 SWC. 
The Organizer must make the Tournament Tier and the Army 
Points known when the event is first announced so players can 
take that into account when building their Army Lists 
SCENARIOS 
The Organizer must choose an Official ITS Scenario for each 
Tournament Round. The same Scenario cannot be played twice 
during a tournament. The Organizer must make the chosen 
Scenarios known when the tournament is first announced so 
that players can take them into account when building their 
Army Lists. 
In addition to the list of selectable Scenarios, the Organizer may 
add only one personalized Scenario to the tournament.
DIAMETER OF ITS TOKENS 
To make the work of an Organizer easier when preparing an ITS 
Tournament, this chart contains the diameters of all the Tokens 
that are used in the different missions.

DENSITY OF TERRAIN
There is no minimum or maximum number of scenery elements 
that a gaming table must include. The key point is to strike a 
good balance in the amount of scenery used. It is best to avoid 
having wide open spaces without cover because moving around 
will be too hard, as well as to avoid layouts that are too densely 
packed with terrain and might keep troops with long-range 
weapons from getting a chance to shine.
Many tournament organizers recommend using nine large 
scenery elements, four to five mid-sized ones, and a good 
number of smaller elements that will provide cover and allow 
your troops to move around more safely.
However, the best way to learn how many terrain pieces you 
need for an Infinity game is by setting up lots of gaming tables. 
Experience and players’ comments will become your reference 
for adapting to each game the amount of scenery you need.
TERRAIN LAYOUT 
You can find a guide to setting up Infinity gaming tables on the 
Infinity rulebook. However, here you will find a few additional 
tips that can be useful when you are organizing a tournament.
When setting up a gaming table, you can mentally divide it into 
quadrants, which will make it easier to distribute the scenery 
pieces more evenly and avoid having areas of the table where 
there is no cover for the troops.
It is important to check lines of fire, even along the edges of the 
table, as well as to try to avoid a layout of the terrain that would 
allow a sniper to control the entire table or a paratrooper to take 
the entire back edge of a Deployment Zone.
There is one important point that should not be overlooked: 
gaming tables can also be asymmetrical! This way, choosing 
your Deployment Zone at the beginning of the game takes on 
new importance. When this type of layout is used, both zones 
should be made interesting in different ways. For instance, one 
zone could have more elements for cover, while the other one 
could have wider open spaces, but offer some high vantage 
points.
You must make sure that all mission objectives cannot be 
controlled from a single point on the table. And of course, don’t 
be shy about placing them on top of a scenery element: that is 
what Movement Skills are for!
EXAMPLE WITH A COUPLE OF TABLE LAYOUTS
INFINITY TABLES

You can set up an Infinity table any way you like, there are many ways to do this and, as a player or tournament organizer, 
you should not be afraid to try different things, because there is not a single perfect way of doing it. The table setup will 
allow players to come up with their different strategies, which will make each game a unique experience.
However, those organizers who are planning their first tournaments will find here some tips from the community on how to 
set up Infinity tables.
11
THEMATIC TABLES 
Anything can be used to set up an Infinity table! From a simple 
shoebox to an amazing building made by an official partner. As 
long as there is a good amount of cover so that the game does 
not become a mere shootout, it will be more than enough. But 
a table that looks good and “tells a story” will make for a much 
better gaming experience. It is not the same thing to infiltrate a 
secret facility located inside a futuristic building to steal some 
precious high-tech as to capture an important HVT who is just 
hiding between some cookie boxes.
A thematic table may also allow to take advantage of terrain 
rules and give troops with those skills a chance to stand out.
In a nutshell, taking into account the different skills of the troops 
when setting up the table will make for epic and memorable 
moments in each game.
12
CIVILIANS IN INFINITY
Covert operations are the brand of Infinity, and those are usually 
highly precise and surgical missions executed when there is no 
one to witness, just to keep their secrecy. 
However, sometimes the objectives of the mission can include 
civilians. In these situations, Troopers can interact with non-
combatant personnel, performing what is called a CivEvac. 
The rules of engagement however prevent causing harm to 
civilians.
EFFECTS
 
►A Civilian is a game element with a Unit Profile that does not belong to the Army 
List of any player. 
 
►Therefore, Civilians cannot be part of any Combat Group and don’t provide Orders 
to any Order Pool. 
 
►Civilians are Neutral, unless some rule, Special Skill or piece of Equipment states 
the contrary.
 
►Civilians do not block LoF.
 
►Civilians do not provide CC MODs. 
 
►Civilians ignore the Effects and Damage they could suffer, whether from an Attack 
or any other source. Therefore, they lack the ARM, BTS, and Wounds Attributes. 
 
►Some Scenario Special Rules or mission Objectives can modify this rule. 
 
►Civilians cannot activate Deployable weapons or pieces of Equipment. 
 
►Civilians do not generate AROs. 
 
►Templates that affect a Civilian are not cancelled, but will have no effect on the 
Civilian.
SEASON 17

CIVEVAC
This Common Skill allows a Model to control a Civilian in game.
CIVEVAC
SHORT MOVEMENT SKILL
Optional, Scenario.
REQUIREMENTS
 
►Only Models, and not Markers (Camouflage, for example) can perform 
this Common Skill. Any Marker which declares CivEvac is automatically 
revealed.
 
►Troopers must be in or reach Silhouette contact with the targeted Civilian.
 
►The targeted Civilian cannot be in Silhouette contact with an enemy Model, 
and cannot have a CivEvac Token. 
 
►A Trooper cannot declare this Common Skill if any of the following is true: 
 
►It is already CivEvacing two Civilians.
 
►It possesses the Impetuous Special Skill, or has gained it via the Frenzy 
Special Skill, or other game circumstance. 
 
►It possesses the Peripheral Special Skill. 
 
►Its Troop Type is REM or VH. 
 
►It is performing a Coordinated Order or is part of a Fireteam.
EFFECTS
 
►If the Trooper successfully passes a WIP+3 Roll, a Trooper can CivEvac the 
Civilian, placing a CivEvac Token by the Civilian to indicate this.
 
►If the roll is failed, this can be repeated as many times as necessary, each 
time spending the corresponding Short Skill and making the roll.
 
►The CivEvaced Civilian always remains in Silhouette contact with the 
Trooper which is CivEvacing it. 
 
►At the end of the Trooper’s movement, place the Civilian in Silhouette 
contact with them. The Trooper must end their movement in a position 
where the Civilian can be placed in Silhouette contact. 
 
►The maximum number of Civilians a Trooper can have CivEvaced with 
them is two. 
 
►The Civilian must always be kept on the table, even if the Trooper which is 
CivEvacing it enters a Null State. 
 
►In the following situations the CivEvac is automatically cancelled at the 
end of the Order, removing the CivEvac Token: 
 
►The Trooper that is CivEvacing the Civilian enters the Isolated State, any 
Null or Immobilized State, or any other State that indicates so. 
 
►The Trooper that is CivEvacing the Civilian becomes part of a Fireteam.
 
►The Trooper that is CivEvacing the Civilian enters a State that replaces 
the Model with a Marker (Camouflaged, Impersonation, Holoecho…). 
 
►The Trooper that is CivEvacing the Civilian gains the Impetuous Skill via 
the Frenzy Special Skill, or other game circumstance. 
 
►The Trooper can cancel the CivEvac voluntarily when activated by any 
Order or ARO, removing the CivEvac Token, with no Roll required.
 
►When the CivEvac is cancelled the Civilian must be left on a horizontal 
surface of the game table. 
 
►If the Civilian is Hostile, due to any game condition or Scenario Special 
Rule, then the WIP Roll to CivEvac does not apply the +3 MOD. 
 
►A Hostile Civilian is identified by a Hostile Token.
CIVILIAN RULE AND CIVEVAC GAME EXAMPLE

During her Active Turn, the PanOceanian player declares 
the first Basic Skill of her Orc Trooper: Move until they reach 
Silhouette contact with a Neoterran Corporate Executive, 
the PanOceanian HVT, a Civilian. With the second Short Skill 
of the Order, the player declares CivEvac and succeeds at a 
WIP+3 Roll, placing a CivEvac Token besides the HVT. 

In the next Order, the PanOceanian player declares Move 
again as the first Short Movement Skill of their Orc Trooper. 
Now, the HVT will move in Silhouette contact with the 
Orc Trooper. In the second Short Movement Skill of the 
Order, the PanOceanian player declares Dodge to avoid an 
incoming Attack. As the Orc Trooper wins the Face to Face 
Roll, he can also Move up to 2 inches, with the HVT moving 
besides him in Silhouette contact. In the next Order, the 
PanOceanian player declares Jump, so the Orc Trooper and 
the HVT in Silhouette contact can move over an obstacle, 
placing them on the other side of it.

In a further Order, the PanOceanian player declares 
Move again as the first Short Movement Skill of their Orc 
Trooper. That move places the HVT in the Line of Fire of a 
Gangbuster. However, as Civilians don’t trigger AROs, the 
O-12 Trooper cannot react. Then, the PanOceanian player 
declares the second short Skill of the Order: Move again. 
Now the Orc Trooper enters the Line of Fire (LoF) of the 
Gangbuster, who can declare an ARO: a BS Attack with 
his Light Riotstopper. As this is a Direct Template Weapon 
it affects the HVT. The PanOceanian player declares the 
second Short Skill of the Order: a BS Attack with his 
MULTI Rifle against the Gangbuster, because the HVT, as a 
Civilian, doesn’t block LoF. The HVT will ignore the Effects 
of the Adhesive Ammunition. However, the Orc is affected 
normally by the Template and will have to perform a PH-6 
Roll. 

In the next Game Round, an Epsilon has used his Climbing 
Plus Special Skill to end a Move hanging halfway up a wall 
with a CivEvaced HVT in Silhouette contact. During the 
player’s Active Turn, the Epsilon enters the Unconscious 
State. The HVT is no longer CivEvaced, so the player must 
remove the CivEvac Token and place the HVT on the game 
table, in contact with the wall, since the HVT cannot stay 
hanging halfway up the wall. 
14
DESIGNATED TARGET 
In some scenarios, the enemy HVTs are considered enemy 
Troopers instead of Neutral Civilians, so they can be targeted 
by Attacks. HVTs that are Designated Targets are reactive 
and hostile, reacting as if they are an enemy Trooper. In these 
scenarios, players will use the following Trooper Profile for 
HVTs:

CASEVAC
This skill allows Troopers to carry other figures that are in a 
Stunned, Immobilized, or Unconscious State.
CASEVAC
SHORT MOVEMENT SKILL
Optional.
REQUIREMENTS
 
►Only Models and not Markers can perform this Common Skill. Any Marker 
which declares Casevac is automatically revealed.
 
►The Trooper must be in Silhouette contact with an allied Trooper in a 
Stunned, Immobilized (IMM-A or IMM-B), or Unconscious State. Some 
Scenario Special Rules may modify this.
 
►The Trooper must have a PH value equal to or greater than the PH value 
of the Trooper it intends to carry. Troopers with the Baggage piece of 
Equipment can ignore this Requirement.
EFFECTS
 
►This allows a Trooper to activate Casevac State
CASEVAC STATE
CASEVAC
ACTIVATION
 
►A Trooper uses the Casevac Common Skill on an allied Trooper in Immobilized 
(IMM-A or IMM-B), Stunned, or Unconscious State.
 
►Troopers can only activate the Casevac state if they possess a PH Attribute equal to 
or higher than the PH Attribute of the Trooper they want to carry.
EFFECTS
 
►While in Casevac State, the player activates both Troopers with one single Order 
or ARO. 
 
►In Casevac State, the player will move both troopers simultaneously in Silhouette 
contact, using the MOV values of the carrying Trooper. 
 
►In this State, the carried Trooper (who is in an Immobilized, Stunned, or 
Unconscious State) cannot declare or perform Orders or AROs. Any Order or ARO 
will be always declared and performed by the carrying Trooper. 
 
►In Casevac State, both Troopers provoke only one ARO from each enemy within 
LoF or ZOC. 
 
►Players declaring an Attack with a Template Weapon against a Trooper that 
declared Casevac or the carried Trooper must apply the Template Weapons Into 
Close Combat rule.
 
►In Casevac State, the carried Trooper does not block LoF. 
 
►In Casevac State, the carried Trooper does not provide the MOD of +1 to B when 
engaging in CC.
 
►Unless a Special Scenario Rule indicates the contrary, a Trooper in Casevac State 
cannot carry more than one Immobilized, Stunned or Unconscious Trooper.
CANCELATION
 
►Casevac State is automatically cancelled if the Trooper that declared Casevac 
declares a Skill other than Cautious Movement, Climb, Dodge, Jump, Reset, or a 
Short Movement Skill. 
 
►This State is also cancelled if the Trooper that declared Casevac is activated in the 
Impetuous Phase. 
 
►In the same way, Casevac State is cancelled when the Trooper that declared 
Casevac the State enters any Immobilized or Null State, or any other State that 
indicates so. 
 
►This State is also cancelled if the Trooper that declared Casevac enters a State 
which replaces the Model with a Marker (Camouflaged, Impersonation, 
Holoecho…).
 
►This State is automatically cancelled if the carried Trooper recovers from the 
Immobilized(IMM-A or IMM-B), Stunned, or Unconscious State. 
 
►The Trooper that declared Casevac can cancel it voluntarily by spending a Short 
Skill of an Order, with no Roll required.
15
LONG SERVICE 
During this season any Trooper whose Trooper Classification 
is listed as ‘Character’ also have the Trooper Classification of 
Veteran Troop.
TREASURE HUNTERS
During this Season players can include a Sāchā in their Army 
List. 
In addition, when playing any scenario during this ITS Season:
	
^ Each player must deploy one Treasure Token (25mm) at 
the beginning of their Deployment Phase.  
	
^ The players must deploy their Treasure Tokens a 
minimum of 4 inches outside of any Deployment Zones. 
Moreover, the players cannot place their Treasure 
Tokens either on top of or inside of any Scenery Item 
or Building, always deploying them in an accessible 
location on the table.
At the end of the game, the player can replace one of their 
Classified Objectives with Secure Treasure. This is an optional 
Classified Objective all players can choose, replacing one of the 
Classified Objectives they drew from the Classified Deck.
The Secure Treasure optional Classified Objective is 
accomplished when, at the end of the game, the player has one 
of their Troopers (who is not in a Null State) inside the Zone of 
Control of the enemy Treasure and at the same time, the Zone 
of Control of their own Treasure is free of enemy Troopers (not 
counting those in a Null State).
The Secure Treasure optional Classified Objective provides the 
same number of Objective Points the scenario provides for each 
normal Classified Objective accomplished. 
A Classified Objective that has been renounced, to be used as an 
INTELCOM Card, cannot be replaced with Secure Treasure.
A Sāchā can Secure Treasure even if the player’s own 
Treasure Token is not free of enemy Troopers.
A player can only replace one of their Classified Objectives to 
Secure Treasure or Secure HVT.
In addition, Sāchās can gain weapons and pieces of equipment 
from Treasure Tokens by using the Open Treasure  Short Skill.
OPEN TREASURE
SHORT SKILL
Attack, Scenario
REQUIREMENTS
 
►The Trooper must be a Sāchā in Silhouette contact with a Treasure Token. 
EFFECTS
 
►By spending one Short Skill, without needing to perform a Roll, the Sāchā 
can make a Roll on the Treasure Chart to obtain one weapon or piece of 
equipment. Once a success has been rolled, that Sāchā cannot use this 
Treasure Token again.
 
►A Treasure Token is not removed from the table after it has been opened.
 
►If the Sāchā rolls a weapon or piece of equipment they already have, they 
can repeat the roll on the Treasure Chart.

EXTRAS
The Organizer may choose to use one or more of the following modifiers of the tournament format. In that case, the 
Organizer must specify which Extras will be used when the event is first announced.
ESCALATION TOURNAMENT 
The tournaments applying this Extra will only have three 
Tournament Rounds, independently of the number of players. 
The first Round will be played with a 200/150-Tier, the 
second Round with a 300/250-Tier and the last Round of the 
Tournament with a 400/350-Tier. The Organizer must make the 
Army Points known when the event is first announced. Each 
Round will apply the pertinent K factor of the tournament. 
With this Extra, each player must have three Army Lists, each 
one adapted to the corresponding Tier. 
FREE GAME 
This Extra removes the limit of 15 Troopers in an Army List. 
So, a player can use Army Lists with more than 15 Troopers in 
them. 
SPEC-OPS
This Extra allows players to field a Spec-Ops in their 
tournament lists (see Daedalus’ Fall).
Spec-Ops can be customized with 12 Experience Points. 
Players can use a differently customized Spec-Ops for each 
army list, but no alterations can be made during the tournament. 
Spec-Ops configurations must be noted in writing along with the 
army list they are in.
The Spec-Ops have the Specialist Operative Special Skill and 
will be considered a Specialist Troop in those scenarios that 
state it, and can apply the Special Rules the scenario specifies 
for these Troopers. 
Spec-Ops earn no further Experience Points during this type of 
tournament.
SOLDIERS OF FORTUNE
This Extra lets players include Mercenary Troops in their Army List.
Players must respect the Availability within the Unit Profile, 
ignoring the limitations established by the Army or Sectorial. 
Each player can include up to 85 points of Mercenary Troops in 
their Army List. 
The Mercenary Troops can be different for each of the two 
player Army Lists. 
Fielding mercenaries in this way COSTS 1 SWC in that Army List. 
The use of this Extra does not allow duplication of Characters.
DIRECT ACTION 
The Direct Action extra consists of a complete set of four 
scenarios, which you will find at the end of this booklet, that 
don’t make use of the Classified Deck or HVT Models.
This is the ‘no frills’ tournament extra. Without terrain rules or 
Classified Objective mechanics. Just a set of main objectives 
and your tactical skills versus those of your opponent. 
If you have recently started playing Infinity and are eager to 
put your skills to the test right away, before learning the full 
mechanics of ITS tournaments, Direct Action is perfect for you. 
A set of scenarios that will allow you to focus on the mission 
at hand and test your tactical abilities. But make no mistake, 
because these scenarios are not easier: although they don’t 
include all the ITS mechanics, they don’t leave out anything else. 
In Direct Action, the mission comes first. 
For veteran players who are well versed in Infinity, a word 
of warning: these are not the exact same scenarios you are 
familiar with. Objectives and scoring have been modified, so the 
game experience is different. Here your Terrain Special Skills 
will not give you advantages, and you won’t enjoy the flexibility 
for scoring points that Classified Objectives offer. If you thought 
you were on safe ground, you are about to find out how wrong 
you were!
17
REINFORCEMENTS
With this Extra, the Reinforcement Rules are used during the 
tournament (see the Reinforcements Annex). All players must 
use Reinforcements.
RESILIENCE OPERATIONS
This tournament extra is a new and different way to play games. 
It will test the resilience of the players and their capacity to 
overcome unexpected difficulties. 
As Official Events, all Tournaments must comply with the Basic 
Rules of ITS; with the exception that they do not use the ITS 
scenarios nor the Classified Deck. Players must use the Tactical 
Objectives Deck and the Battle Conditions Deck. 
You will find the rules in the Resilience Operations section of 
this document.
CLASSIFIED OBJECTIVES

In the Infinity Official Scenarios, the Classified Objectives are additional objectives a player can accomplish to get more 
Objective Points.
Usually, each Classified Objective provides 1 Objective Point, but this number can vary due to the special conditions of the 
scenario. 
Each Classified Objective provides its Objective Points one time in each scenario. Even if the requirements of the Classified 
Objective are achieved again, it will not provide additional Objective Points
CLASSIFIED 
OBJECTIVES SELECTION  
The number of Classified Objectives that can be fulfilled during 
the mission is listed on the scenario report. In the ITS, players 
have only one way of choosing the Classified Objectives, with the 
Classified Deck. 
Players draw their Classified Objectives after learning what 
mission will be played and what faction their opponent will be 
playing with, but always before choosing one of the two Army 
Lists shown to the tournament organizer. 
INTELCOM CARD
As stated in some scenarios, it is possible to renounce the use of 
a Classified Objective, to use it as INTELCOM Card (Support and 
Control, or Interference). 
Before the beginning of the game, but after choosing the 
Classified Objective, each player must decide if that card will be 
their Classified Objective or their INTELCOM Card, announcing 
their decision to their adversary. Each player rolls a die and the 
one who gets the highest score must make their decision first 
and inform their adversary. The content of the card, whether 
the mission, the card numeric value or symbol, is Private 
Information, no matter which use the player has chosen for it. 
When specified in the mission, and in Initiative order, the player 
can use their INTELCOM Card.
CLASSIFIED DECK
Each player must shuffle their own Classified Deck in front of 
their opponent and draw two cards for each Classified Objective 
determined in the scenario. He will be allowed to discard one of 
them. The discard will take place before drawing the next two 
cards for the following Classified Objective. 
The Classified Objectives are Private Information until they are 
fulfilled. The player must keep their Classified Objective cards 
and show them to their opponent if he demands it once the 
Objective has been fulfilled.
18
HIGH VALUE 
TARGET (HVT) MODEL
The HVT (High Value Target) represents a non-combatant 
character belonging to the enemy side and placed on the game 
table as the target of Classified Objectives. 
The deployment of one of these Models is compulsory for both 
players, as their presence and interaction with other Troopers 
in-game has consequences for the achievement of Classified 
Objectives when playing scenarios. 
You can use any figure from the Infinity or the Infinity Bootleg 
range, preferably those designated as HVT or as a Civilian. 
Good examples of this are the O-12 High Commissioner, the 
Tohaa Diplomat, the Freelance Stringer, Fusilier Angus, the VIP 
Executive or the HAZMAT A1 Specialist.
The HVT Models may be necessary to accomplish some 
Classified Objectives. However, these Models are especially 
useful when a player replaces one of their Classified Objectives 
with Secure the HVT.
REQUIREMENTS
 
►Each player must deploy one HVT Model at the beginning of their Deployment 
Phase. 
 
►The players must deploy their HVT Models a minimum of 4 inches outside of any 
Deployment Zones. Moreover, the players cannot place their HVT Models either 
on top of or inside of any Scenery Item or Building, always deploying them in an 
accessible location on the table.
EFFECTS
 
►HVT Models are Neutral Civilians to both players.
SECURE HVT 
CLASSIFIED OBJECTIVE 
At the end of the game, the player can replace one of their 
Classified Objectives with Secure HVT. This is an optional 
Classified Objective all players can choose, replacing one of the 
Classified Objectives they drew from the Classified Deck. 
The Secure HVT optional Classified Objective is accomplished 
when, at the end of the game, the player has one of their 
Troopers (who is not in a Null State) inside the Zone of Control of 
the enemy HVT and at the same time, the Zone of Control of their 
own HVT is free of enemy Troopers (not counting those in a Null 
State). 
The Secure HVT optional Classified Objective provides the same 
number of Objective Points the scenario provides for each 
normal Classified Objective accomplished. 
A Classified Objective that has been renounced, to be used as an 
INTELCOM Card, cannot be replaced with Secure HVT.
TACTICAL SUPPORT
In official Infinity scenarios, Tactical Support offers additional 
tools to help players accomplish mission objectives or to furnish 
Troopers other bonuses.
TACTICAL SUPPORT SELECTION 
Each scenario specifies the number of Tactical Support options 
the player has. In ITS games, the selection of Tactical Support 
options must always be done using the Tactical Objectives Deck. 
Players must draw their Tactical Support options after choosing 
one of their two Army Lists. 
Each player must remove all the Tactical cards without a symbol 
from the Tactical Objective Deck (King of the Hill, Central Control, 
Z Domination and, N Domination). Then each player must shuffle 
their own Tactical Objective Deck in front of their opponent, and 
draw the number of cards specified in the scenario. Tactical 
Support options are Open Information. 
The Trooper chosen to recieve a Tactical Support Option must be 
always one of the models deployed on the game table. Players 
are not allowed to choose Troopers in Hidden Deployment or in 
Marker state. This Trooper must always be on the game table as 
a Model and not as a Marker (Camouflaged, Holoecho…). Also, 
Irregular Troops and those whose Troop Type is REM or VH are 
not eligible to receive a Tactical Support Option.

ITS SCENARIOS
ITS SCENARIOS 
The tactical flexibility of the game mechanics of Infinity allows for the games to be much more than simply setting out to 
exterminate the enemy. In the ITS (Infinity Tournament System), the organized game system of Infinity, games are laid out with a set 
number of objectives to meet (e.g. take control of a building), or specific game conditions (e.g. Special Terrain Areas). These kinds 
of games are referred to as missions or scenarios, and they recreate tactical situations as well as operations from the military 
sphere and espionage circles of the highest levels. Granted, a mission or a scenario means a higher level of difficulty, requiring 
greater planning of the Army List as well as a more polished set of tactical and gaming abilities on the part of the player. 
However, they also mean a greater level of fun and entertainment than the regular extermination game. 
Thanks to the Warcor Tristan228 for his invaluable help and incredible work with the scenario maps.

SCENARIO SPECIAL RULES 
COMMON CLASSIFIED OBJECTIVES
Both players share 2 Common Classified Objectives each Game 
Round, which are Public Information.
At the beginning of the first Game Round, each player must 
shuffle their Classified Deck in front of their opponent. Then 
each player must draw two cards, select one of them as their 
Private Classified Objective, and the other as a Common 
Classified Objective for the first Game Round. Once both players 
have selected a Common Classified Objective, they are revealed 
at the same time.
At the beginning of Game Rounds two and three, any current 
Common Classified Objective cards that have not been 
accomplished by either player are discarded. The Common 
Classified Objective cards that have been accomplished are 
moved to a separate area, so that each player can keep track 
of which cards have been accomplished. Player A and Player 
B Tokens can be used to mark which player has accomplished 
each Common Classified Objective card. It is recommended each 
player uses a different kind of Token.
Each player then draws two cards from their Classified Deck, 
chooses one as a Common Classified Objective, and discards the 
other.
Any Common Classified Objective that is checked “at the end 
of the game” or “during the game” can be accomplished at the 
end of any Player Turn. If both players accomplished the same 
Common Classified Objective in the same Round, both players 
have accomplished it. A Common Classified Objective can only 
be accomplished after it has been drawn.
If a player’s deck runs out of cards, shuffle their discard pile into 
a new deck.
PRIVATE CLASSIFIED OBJECTIVE
A Private Classified Objective cannot be used to Emit Akial 
Interference, and cannot be canceled by it.
The Private Classified Objectives are Private Information.
SIGNAL REDUNDANCY
If, upon revealing the Common Classified Objectives, both have 
the same name, the player with the first Player Turn must draw 
another card from their Classified Deck and place it as an extra 
Common Classified Objective.
Two Classified Objectives with the same name, whether 
Common or Private, can both be accomplished in the same 
Player Turn as long as they each have a different target or are 
accomplished by a different Trooper.
MULTIPLE HVTS 
Each of the players will deploy four HVTs, following the usual rules 
for deploying HVTs. Each HVT may only be used to accomplish one 
Classified Objective - once a Classified Objective targeting an HVT 
has been completed, that HVT Model is removed from the game 
table.
23
SECURE HVT OR SECURE 
TREASURE NOT USED  
In this scenario, the Secure HVT or Secure Treasure rule is not 
applied.
AKIAL ANTENNA
There is 1 Akial Antenna placed in the center of the table. 
The Akial Antenna must be represented by a Transmission 
Antenna Token (TRANS. ANTENNA) or with a scenery piece of 
the same diameter (such as the Antenna of the ITS Objective 
Pack Alpha, the Communications Array by Warsenal or the Sat 
Station Antenna by Customeeple).

►Spending one Short Skill, without needing to perform a Roll, the player 
can Relocate the Tracking Beacon.
 
►Place the Tracking Beacon anywhere within 4 inches of its previous 
position.
COMMON RULES 
OF THE TRACKING BEACON 
When moving the Tracking Beacon, the following rules must be 
followed:
	
^ The final position of the Tracking Beacon must be fully 
supported by the surface it is placed on, and it cannot be 
placed on a vertical surface.
	
^ It must be possible to draw a path between the Tracking 
Beacon’s starting and final positions. The path cannot be 
blocked by an impassable obstacle (for example a wall 
of infinite height, a closed door or sealed room...) or a 
gap too small for the diameter of the Tracking Beacon to 
pass through.
	
^ The Tracking Beacon is placed in its final position at the 
Conclusion of the Order. 
CONTROL THE TRACKING BEACON
At the end of each Game Round, the Tracking Beacon is 
Controlled by a player as long as that player is the only one with 
at least one Trooper (as a Model, not a Marker) in Silhouette 
contact with it. So there cannot be any enemy Troopers in 
Silhouette contact with the Tracking Beacon. Models in a Null 
State cannot do either.
CONSOLES
There are two Consoles, placed on the central line of the 
game table. They are placed 12 inches from the table edges in 
300/350/400 point games, 8 inches in 200/250 point games, 
and 6 inches in 150 point games (see map).
Each Console must be represented by a Console A Token or by a 
scenery piece of the same diameter (such as the Consoles from 
the ITS Objectives Pack Alpha, the Human Consoles by Micro Art 
Studio, the Tech Consoles by Warsenal or the Comlink Console 
by Customeeple).
ACTIVATE CONSOLE
SHORT SKILL
Attack, Scenario.
REQUIREMENTS
 
►Only Specialist Troops can declare this Skill.
 
►The Specialist Troop must be in Silhouette contact with the Console. 
 
►The Tracking Beacon cannot be in Silhouette contact with a Trooper.
 
►Each Specialist Troop can only successfully Activate a Console once per 
Game Round. 
EFFECTS
 
►Allows the Specialist Troop to make a Normal WIP Roll to Activate the 
Console. If the roll is failed, this can be repeated as many times as 
necessary, each time spending the corresponding Short Skill and making 
the roll.
 
►Once you successfully have Activated the Console, you must choose and 
perform one of the following actions:
 
►Nudge the Tracking Beacon: Place the Tracking Beacon anywhere 
within 2 inches of its current position. 
 
►Magnetize the Tracking Beacon: Place the Tracking Beacon within 6 
inches of its current position and directly towards the center of the 
game table. This action cannot be used to move the Tracking Beacon 
beyond the center of the table. 
26
NO QUARTER
In this scenario, the Retreat! rules are not applied.
END OF THE MISSION
This scenario has a limited time frame, so it will automatically 
finish at the end of the third Game Round.
CONTROL THE CONSOLE
At the end of each Game Round, a Console is Controlled by a 
player as long as that player is the only one with at least one 
Trooper (as a Model, not a Marker) in Silhouette contact with it. 
So there cannot be any enemy Troopers in Silhouette contact 
with the Console. Models in a Null State cannot do either.
SPECIALIST TROOPS
For the purposes of this scenario, only Hackers, Doctors, 
Engineers, Forward Observers, Paramedics, and Troopers 
possessing the Chain of Command or the Specialist Operative 
Special Skill are considered Specialist Troops.
Hackers, Doctors, and Engineers cannot make use of Repeaters 
or Peripheral (Servant) Models to perform tasks reserved for 
Specialist Troops.

SCENARIO SPECIAL RULES 
PROTOTYPE
There are 2 Prototypes, 1 belonging to each player, on the 
central line of the table. They are placed 12 inches from the 
table edges in 300/350/400 point games, 8 inches in 200/250 
point games, and 6 inches in 150 point games. 
Before the Deployment Phase, the player with the second Turn 
decides which Prototype belongs to which player.
Each Prototype must be represented by an Objective Token or 
by a scenery piece of the same diameter (such as the Objective 
of the ITS Objectives Pack or the Alpha Info Hubs by Micro Art 
Studio).
In this scenario the Prototypes have a Profile and can be 
targeted.

FIXED CC ROLL= 8, GIZMOKIT (PH=9)
AUTOMATED DEFENSE SYSTEM (ADS)  
Every Prototype is equipped with an ADS to avoid tampering 
with the Prototype system. Any CC Attack made against 
the Prototype will trigger a CC Attack in reaction, which 
automatically rolls an 8. Any CC Attack against the Prototype is 
automatically a Face to Face Roll. No MODs can be applied to the 
attacker’s CC Attribute. 
If the ADS’s Roll of 8 is a success, the attacker suffers a Stun 
Ammunition hit, forcing them to make one Saving Roll against 
BTS, with PS 5. The Immunity (Enhanced) and Immunity (BTS) 
Special Skills are not effective against this hit.
DESTROY THE PROTOTYPES  
A Prototype can only be damaged by CC Attacks with Weapons 
possessing the Anti-materiel Trait, or by placing D-Charges. 
The Prototype is Destroyed and must be removed from the 
gaming table when it suffers a number of Wounds equal or 
higher than its STR Attribute value. 
The Prototype can be the target of the Engineer Special Skill or 
the GizmoKit piece of Equipment
Attacks cannot be declared against Prototypes during the first 
Game Round, with the exception of Pick Up Prototype.

REQUIREMENTS 
The Trooper must be in one of the following situations: 
 
►Be in Silhouette contact with an allied Trooper in a Normal State with an 
Enemy Prototype.
 
►Be in Silhouette contact with an Enemy Prototype Token that is not being 
carried.
EFFECTS 
 
►Spending one Short Skill, without needing a Roll, any Trooper can pick up 
an Enemy Prototype in any of the situations previously mentioned. 
 
►The Trooper must follow the Common Rules of Prototypes.
COMMON RULES OF PROTOTYPES  
	
^ A Trooper carrying a Prototype cannot declare Move as 
the second Basic Short Skill of an Order. As an exception, 
Troopers possessing the Baggage Special Skill can 
declare Move as the second Basic Short Skill of the 
Order.
	
^ Only Models, and not Markers, (Camo, Impersonation, 
Holoechoes…) can carry the Prototypes.
	
^ The Prototype Token must always be kept on the table.
	
^ The Prototype Token always remains in Silhouette 
contact with the Trooper which is carrying it.
	
^ If the Trooper carrying the Prototype enters or is in any 
Null State, they drop the Prototype. Move the Prototype 
slightly out of Silhouette contact with the Trooper
	
^ Prototype Tokens do not block movement or LoF.
CAPTURING ENEMY PROTOTYPE  
A Enemy Prototype is Captured by a player if, at the end of the 
game, that player has a Model, but not a Marker, carrying it. That 
Trooper cannot be in a Null State or in Silhouette contact with 
any enemy Model.
29
PANOPLIES
There are a total of 2 Panoplies, placed in different halves of the 
table, each in the middle of the front edge of the Deployment 
Zone. (see map)
Each Panoply must be represented by an Objective Token or by a 
scenery piece of the same diameter (such as the Objective of the 
ITS Objectives Pack or the Alpha Info Hubs by Micro Art Studio).

different weapon or piece of equipment. Once a success has been rolled, 
that Trooper cannot use this Panoply again.
 
►Troopers possessing the Booty Special Skill, or any other Skill which 
specifies so, don’t need to make the WIP Roll. 
 
►A Trooper in Silhouette contact with this piece of scenery may spend one 
Short Skill of an Order to cancel their Unloaded State.

Superior Deployment Labels cannot be used to deploy inside 
this area. 
SCENARIO SPECIAL RULES 
ATTACKER AND DEFENDER
In this scenario, two distinct roles are established: Attacker and 
Defender. Each has different Main Objectives.
The player with the first Player Turn is the Attacker. The player 
with the second Player Turn is the Defender.
Before the Deployment Phase, the Defender may spend 1 single 
Command Token to perform one of the following actions:
	
^ Activate the Server Room Defense System.
	
^ Ignore the Deployment Restriction for the Server Room. 
You can deploy up to 65 points of Troops from your Army 
List, anywhere in the Server Room. This does not require 
the use of Special Skills with the Superior Deployment 
Label. 
32
IMPORTANT
This use of a Command Token is in addition to the Strategic 
Use of Command Tokens.
SERVER ROOM
In this scenario the Server Room is a Zone of Operations (ZO). 
Placed in the center of the table, it covers an area of 8 by 8 
inches. To represent the Server Room, we recommend using the 
Objective Room by Micro Art Studio, the Command Bunker by 
Warsenal, or the Panic Room by Customeeple. 
In game terms it is considered to have walls of infinite height 
that completely block Line of Fire. It has four Gates, one in the 
middle of each wall (see map). The Gates of the Server Room 
are open at the start of the game. The Server Room Gates must 
be represented by a Wide Gate Token or a scenery piece with the 
same size.
DOMINATE ZO 
A Zone of Operations (ZO) is Dominated by a player if they have 
more Victory Points than the adversary inside the area. Only 
Troopers represented by Models or Markers (Camouflaged, 
Shasvastii-Embryo...) count, as well as Proxies and Peripheral 
Troops. Troops in a Null State do not count. Tokens representing 
weapons or pieces of equipment (like Mines or Deployable 
Repeaters), fake Holoechoes, and any Token that does not 
represent a Trooper does not count either. 
A Trooper is inside a Zone of Operations when more than half 
the Trooper’s base is inside that ZO.
SHASVASTII
Troopers possessing the Shasvastii Special Skill that are inside 
a Zone of Operations count while they are in the Shasvastii-
Embryo State or any non-Null State.
BAGGAGE 
Troopers possessing the Baggage piece of Equipment that are 
inside a Zone of Operations and in a non-Null State provide an 
additional 20 Victory Points for Dominating the ZO.
SERVER ROOM DEFENSE SYSTEM
There are 2 Armed Turrets, placed inside the Server Room in 
different corners (see map). 
The Armed Turrets must be represented by a Defensive Turret 
A /B Token or by a Model or piece of scenery with the same 
Silhouette value (for example Turrets from the ITS Objectives Pack 
Alpha).
If the Server Room’s Defense System is active, the Armed Turrets react 
with BS Attack or CC Attack to any Order declared by an active Enemy 
Model (but not Markers) in LOF or in Silhouette contact.

►If the roll is failed, this can be repeated as many times as necessary, each 
time spending the corresponding Short Skill and making the roll. 
 
►If the Data Console is Unlocked, the roll is a Normal WIP roll without the -6 
MOD.
DATA PACK
The Data Pack must be represented by a DATA PACK Token.
The Trooper who has the Data Pack must always be on the game 
table as a Model and not as a Marker (Camouflaged, Holoecho…).
Once the Data Pack is Extracted, if the Trooper carrying it enters 
Dead State the DATA PACK Token must be removed from the 
game table. 
33
 INHIBITOR ANTENNA 
There is an Inhibitor Antenna placed next to one of the outer 
corners of the Server Room in the Defender’s half of the game 
table. (see map).
The Inhibitor Antenna must be represented by a Transmission 
Antenna Token (TRANS. ANTENNA) or with a scenery piece of 
the same diameter (such as the Antenna of the ITS Objective 
Pack Alpha, the Communications Array by Warsenal or the Sat 
Station Antenna by Customeeple).

KILLING
Troopers are considered Killed by the adversary when they 
enter Dead State, or they are in a Null State at the end of the 
game. 
Troopers that have not been deployed on the game table, as a 
Model or Marker, at the end of the game will be considered to be 
Killed by the adversary. 
INTELCOM CARD 
(SUPPORT AND CONTROL) 
Before the beginning of the game, but after choosing the first 
Classified Objective, the player must inform to their adversary 
if that card will be their Classified Objective or their INTELCOM 
Card. Each player rolls a die and the one who gets the highest 
score must be the first who announces their decision to their 
adversary. The content of the card, whether the mission or the 
card numeric value, is Private Information, no matter which use 
the player has chosen for it. 
At the end of the last Game Round, when the players count 
up their points and in Initiative order, the player can use their 
INTELCOM Card in Support and Control Mode. 
Support and Control Mode: The player can add the value of the 
Support and Control Card to their Victory Points in the Zone of 
Operations (ZO) of their choice. The player must have at least 
one Trooper inside that ZO, in a non-Null State.

SCENARIO SPECIAL RULES 
CIVILIANS
There are a total of four Civilians on the game table, two of them 
in each table half. Each Civilian is placed 16 inches from the rear 
of the Deployment Zone and 6 inches from the edge of the table. 
(see the map). 
For 150 point games, the Civilians are placed 12 inches from the 
rear of the Deployment Zone and 6 inches from the edges of the 
table. (see the map).
The Civilians cannot be placed on top of or inside of any Scenery 
Item or Building, always deploying them in accessible locations 
on the table. Scenery placement must facilitate this.
Players can use any Model from the Infinity or the Infinity 
Bootleg range, preferably those designated as HVT or as a 
Civilian. Good examples of this are the O-12 High Commissioner, 
the Tohaa Diplomat, Go-Go Marlene, the Fusilier Angus, the TAG 
Pilots, the VIP Executive or the HAZMAT A1 Specialist. Players 
can also use the Player A and Player B Tokens to identify or 
even represent their Civilians.
MULTIPLE HVTS
Each of the players deploys two HVTs, following the usual rules 
for deploying HVTs.
EXTRACTION CONSOLES
There are 2 Extraction Consoles, placed on the central line of the 
table. They are placed 16 inches from the edges of the table in 
300/350/400 point games, 12 inches in 200/250 point games, 
and 8 inches in 150 point games (see map). 
Each Console must be represented by a Console A Token or by 
a scenery piece of the same diameter (such as the Consoles of 
the ITS Objective Pack Alpha, the Human Consoles by Micro Art 
Studio, the Tech Consoles by Warsenal or the Comlink Console 
by Customeeple).
ACTIVATE EXTRACTION CONSOLE
SHORT SKILL

REQUIREMENTS
 
►Only Specialist Troops can declare this Skill.
 
►The Specialist Troop must be in Silhouette contact with an Extraction 
Console.
 
►The Specialist Troop must be CivEvacing a Civilian or an Enemy HVT. 
 
►This Skill cannot be declared during the first Game Round.
EFFECTS
 
►Allows the Specialist Troop to make a Normal WIP Roll to Activate an 
Extraction Console.
If the roll is failed, this can be repeated as many times as necessary, each 
time spending the corresponding Short Skill and making the roll.
 
►If the roll is successful, the player chooses one of the Specialist Troop’s 
CivEvaced Civilians or Enemy HVTs. The chosen Civilian or HVT has been 
Extracted, and is removed from the game table.

SPECIALIST TROOPS
For the purposes of this scenario, only Hackers, Doctors, 
Engineers, Forward Observers, Paramedics, and Troopers 
possessing the Chain of Command or the Specialist Operative 
Special Skill are considered Specialist Troops.
Hackers, Doctors, and Engineers cannot make use of Repeaters 
or Peripheral (Servant) Models to perform tasks reserved for 
Specialist Troops.
OPERATIONAL LEARNING
When a Specialist Troop performs a Skill with the Scenario 
Label that requires a WIP Roll and fails, they benefit from the 
following MODs in subsequent Orders:
	
^ In the second consecutive Order, the Trooper applies a 
+3 MOD to the WIP Roll required for that Scenario Skill.
	
^ In the third consecutive Order—and subsequent Orders— 
the Trooper applies +3 and +1SD MODs to the WIP Roll 
required for that Scenario Skill.
	
^ These MODs are cumulative with any other MOD that 
applies to Skills with the Scenario Label. 
IMPORTANT
These MODs only apply to Rolls made in consecutive 
Orders by the same Trooper for the same Scenario Skill, 
with the same target, with no interruptions, or Orders spent 
on other Troopers:
	
^ If the Trooper passes the Roll, the sequence resets.
	
^ If the Trooper do not declare that Scenario Skill, the 
sequence resets. 
	
^ If the Trooper declare the same Skill, but on a different 
target, the sequence resets. 
	
^ If an Order is spent on any other Trooper, the sequence 
resets.
	
^ Only one sequence can be applied per Trooper and per 
Scenario-labelled Skill at a time.
END OF THE MISSION
This scenario has a limited time frame, so it will automatically 
finish at the end of the third Game Round.
If one of the players starts their Active Turn in a Retreat! 
situation, the game will end at the end of that Turn.

►The Trooper is in Silhouette contact with a friendly Trooper in a Normal State 
that has an Enemy Beacon. 
 
►The Trooper is in Silhouette contact with an Enemy Beacon which has no 
enemy Troops in a non-Null State in contact with it.
EFFECTS
 
►A Trooper can pick up an Enemy Beacon in any of the situations previously 
mentioned by spending one Short Skill, without needing to perform a Roll. 
 
►The Troopers must follow the Common Rules of Beacons.
COMMON RULES OF BEACONS 
	
^ Each Model can carry a maximum of 1 Beacon. As an 
exception, Troopers possessing the Baggage Special Skill 
can carry up to 2 Beacons. 
	
^ Only Models, and not Markers, (Camouflaged, 
Impersonation, Holoechoes…) can carry the Beacons. 
	
^ The Beacon must always be kept on the table.
	
^ The Beacon always remains in Silhouette contact with the 
Trooper which is carrying it.
	
^ If the Trooper carrying the Beacon enters or is in any Null 
State, they drop the Beacon. Move the Beacon slightly out of 
Silhouette contact with the Trooper.
	
^ Beacons do not block movement or LoF. 
CONTROL AN ENEMY BEACON
An Enemy Beacon is Controlled by a player as long as that player 
is the only one with at least one Trooper (as a Model, not a Marker) 
in Silhouette contact with it. So there cannot be any enemy 
Troopers in Silhouette contact with the Beacon. Models in a Null 
State cannot do either.
CONSOLES
There are three Consoles, placed on the central line of the game 
table. One of them is in the center of the table, and the other two 
are placed 12 inches from the table edges in 300/350/400 point 
games, 8 inches in 200/250 point games, and 6 inches in 150 point 
games (see map). 
Each Console must be represented by a Console A Token or by

LAUNCHING TOWER (ZO)
In this scenario, the Launching Tower is a Zone of Operations 
(ZO). Placed in the center of the table, it covers an area of 8 by 8 
inches. To represent the Launching Tower, we recommend using 
the Objective Room of the different Infinity Expansion Scenery 
Packs, the Objective Room by Micro Art Studio, the Command 
Bunker by Warsenal, or the Panic Room by Customeeple.
In game terms, it is considered to have walls of infinite height 
that completely block Line of Fire. It has four Wide Gates, one in 
the middle of each wall (see map). The Gates of the Launching 
Tower are open at the start of the game.
DOMINATE ZO 
A Zone of Operations is Dominated by a player if they have 
more Victory Points than the adversary inside the area. Only 
Troopers represented by Models or Markers (Camouflaged, 
Shasvastii-Embryo, …) count, as well as Proxies and Peripheral 
Troops. Troops in a Null State do not count. Tokens representing 
weapons or pieces of equipment (like Mines or Deployable 
Repeaters), fake Holoechoes, and any Token that does not 
represent a Trooper do not count either.
A Trooper is inside the ZO when more than half the Trooper’s 
base is inside that ZO.
SHASVASTII
Troopers possessing the Shasvastii Special Skill that are inside 
a Zone of Operations count while they are in Unconscious State 
or any non-Null State.
BAGGAGE
Each Trooper possessing the Baggage piece of Equipment that 
is Extracted provides an additional 20 points to the player’s 
Extracted Army Points.
Troopers possessing the Baggage piece of Equipment that are 
inside a Zone of Operations and in a non-Null State provide an 
additional 20 Victory Points for Dominating the ZO

When a Specialist Troop performs a Skill with the Scenario 
Label that requires a WIP Roll and fails, they benefit from the 
following MODs in subsequent Orders:
	
^ In the second consecutive Order, the Trooper applies a 
+3 MOD to the WIP Roll required for that Scenario Skill.
	
^ In the third consecutive Order—and subsequent Orders— 
the Trooper applies +3 and +1SD MODs to the WIP Roll 
required for that Scenario Skill.
	
^ These MODs are cumulative with any other MOD that 
applies to Skills with the Scenario Label. 
IMPORTANT:
These MODs only apply to Rolls made in consecutive 
Orders by the same Trooper for the same Scenario Skill, 
with the same target, with no interruptions, or Orders spent 
on other Troopers:
	
^ If the Trooper passes the Roll, the sequence resets.
	
^ If the Trooper do not declare that Scenario Skill, the 
sequence resets. 
	
^ If the Trooper declare the same Skill, but on a different 
target, the sequence resets. 
	
^ If an Order is spent on any other Trooper, the sequence 
resets.
	
^ Only one sequence can be applied per Trooper and per 
Scenario-labelled Skill at a time.

►If there are any enemy Hackers within any Areas of Interest, one of them 
can declare an ARO to oppose the Specialist Trooper. Activating the 
Communication Antenna in this situation is a Face to Face WIP Roll.
 
►If the roll is failed, this can be repeated as many times as necessary, each 
time spending the corresponding Short Skill.
 
►An Activated Communication Antenna can be Activated again by the other 
player, applying the same procedure. In this situation, the Communication 
Antenna is no longer Activated by the adversary.
 
►Player A and Player B Tokens can be used to mark the Activated 
Communication Antenna. It is recommended each player uses a different 
kind of Token.
AREA OF INTEREST
In this scenario the Areas of Interest are Zones of Operations 
(ZO), represented by Circular Templates.
There are a total of three Areas of Interest, one of which is the 
Special Area of Interest.
Before the Deployment Phase, and in Initiative order, each 
player must place their Circular Templates. They can be placed 
on any surface of the game table that is equal or larger in size 
than the Template, must be completely outside any Deployment 
Zones, and cannot overlap another Area of Interest.
The player with the first turn must place an Area of Interest and 
the Special Area of Interest, specifying which Template is the 
Special Area of Interest when placing it. The player with second 
turn places an Area of Interest.
DOMINATE ZO
A Zone of Operations (ZO) is Dominated by a player if they have 
more Victory Points than the adversary inside the area. Only 
Troopers represented by Models or Markers (Camouflaged, 
Shasvastii-Embryo...) count, as well as Proxies and Peripheral 
Troops. Troops in a Null State do not count. Tokens representing 
weapons or pieces of equipment (like Mines or Deployable 
Repeaters), fake Holoechoes, and any Token that does not 
represent a Trooper does not count either. 
A Trooper is inside a Zone of Operations when more than half 
the Trooper’s base is inside that ZO.
SHASVASTII
Troopers possessing the Shasvastii Special Skill that are inside 
a Zone of Operations count while they are in Unconscious State 
or any non-Null State.
50
BAGGAGE
Troopers possessing the Baggage piece of Equipment that are 
inside a Zone of Operations and in a non-Null State provide an 
additional 20 Victory Points for Dominating the ZO.
SPECIALIST TROOPS
For the purposes of this scenario, only Hackers, Doctors, 
Engineers, Forward Observers, Paramedics, and Troopers 
possessing the Chain of Command or the Specialist Operative 
Special Skill are considered Specialist Troops.
Hackers, Doctors, and Engineers cannot make use of Repeaters 
or Peripheral (Servant) Models to perform tasks reserved for 
Specialist Troops.
INTELCOM CARD (SUPPORT AND CONTROL) 
Before the beginning of the game, but after choosing the first 
Classified Objective, the player must inform to their adversary 
if that card will be their Classified Objective or their INTELCOM 
Card. Each player rolls a die and the one who gets the highest 
score must be the first who announces their decision to their 
adversary. The content of the card, whether the mission or the 
card numeric value, is Private Information, no matter which use 
the player has chosen for it. 
At the end of the last Game Round, when the players count 
up their points and in Initiative order, the player can use their 
INTELCOM Card in Support and Control Mode. 
Support and Control Mode: The player can add the value of the 
Support and Control Card to their Victory Points in the Zone of 
Operations (ZO) of their choice. The player must have at least 
one Trooper inside that ZO, in a non-Null State.
END OF THE MISSION 
This scenario has a limited time frame, so it will automatically 
finish at the end of the third Game Round.
If one of the players starts their Active Turn in a Retreat! 
situation, the game will end at the end of that Turn.

SCENARIO SPECIAL RULES  
SECTORS (ZO) 
When the game is finished, but not before, 3 Sectors are marked 
out. In 200/250/300/350/400 point games, these Sectors are 
8 inches deep and as wide as the game table. Two of these 
Sectors are placed 4 inches from the central line of the game 
table, one on each side, and the third Sector is a strip 8 inches 
deep in the central area of the table. 
In 150 point games, these Sectors are 4 inches deep and as 
wide as the game table. Two of these Sectors are placed 2 
inches from the central line of the game table, one on each side, 
and the third Sector is a strip 4 inches deep in the central area 
of the table. 
In this scenario each Sector is a Zone of Operations (ZO).
DOMINATE ZO 
A Zone of Operations (ZO) is Dominated by a player if they have 
more Victory Points than the adversary inside the area. Only 
Troopers represented by Models or Markers (Camouflaged, 
Shasvastii-Embryo...) count, as well as Proxies and Peripheral 
Troops. Troops in a Null State do not count. Tokens representing 
weapons or pieces of equipment (like Mines or Deployable 
Repeaters), fake Holoechoes, and any Token that does not 
represent a Trooper does not count either. 
A Trooper is inside a Zone of Operations when more than half 
the Trooper’s base is inside that ZO.
SHASVASTII 
Troopers possessing the Shasvastii Special Skill that are inside 
a Zone of Operations count while they are in the Unconscious 
State or any non-Null State.
BAGGAGE 
Troopers possessing the Baggage piece of Equipment that are 
inside a Zone of Operations and in a non-Null State provide an 
additional 20 Victory Points for Dominating the ZO.
KILLING 
Troopers are considered Killed by the adversary when they 
enter Dead State, or they are in a Null State at the end of the 
game. 
Troopers that have not been deployed on the game table, as a 
Model or Marker, at the end of the game will be considered to be 
Killed by the adversary. 
KEY OPS
The Key Ops is a special tactics operator with unique training to 
conduct multi-domain reconnaissance and combat across the 
full spectrum of conflicts.
At the end of the Deployment Phase, in Initiative order, players 
must declare which Trooper from their Army List is their Key 
Ops. The Trooper chosen must be always one of the models 
deployed on the game table. Players are not allowed to choose 
Troopers in Hidden Deployment or in Marker state. This Trooper 
must always be on the game table as a Model and not as a 
Marker (Camouflaged, Holoecho…). Also, Irregular Troops and 
those whose Troop Type is REM or VH are not eligible to be Key 
Ops. 
The Key Ops possesses the Dodge (+3) and Tactical Awareness 
Special Skills, even if those are not listed on their Unit Profile. 
These Special Skills are not cumulative, if the Trooper already 
has them, then they are not applied. 
The Key Ops is identified with a Player A or B Marker.
THREATEN KEY OPS 
A Key Ops is Threatened by a player if they have at least one 
Trooper (as a Model, not a Marker) in a non-Null state inside the 
Key Ops’ Zone of Control. 
HVT AND CLASSIFIED DECK NOT USED 
In this scenario, the HVT Model and Secure HVT rules are not 
applied. Players will not deploy the HVT Model on the game 
table and they will not use the Classified Deck in this scenario.

SCENARIO SPECIAL RULES  
REINFORCED TACTICAL LINK  
In this scenario the Loss of Lieutenant rule does not apply. 
In this mission, the identity of the Lieutenant is always Open 
Information. The player must indicate which Marker is the 
Lieutenant if it is in a Marker State (Camouflaged, Decoy...) or 
which Markers are the Lieutenant in the case of a Holoprojector. 
The Lieutenant must be placed on the game table at the 
beginning of the first Game Round, either as a Model or as a 
Marker. Players may not deploy their Lieutenants in Hidden 
Deployment State. 
If the player lacks a Lieutenant during the Tactical Phase of their 
Active Turn because this Trooper was not deployed or because 
it is in the Isolated State or any Null State (Unconscious, Dead, 
Sepsitorized…), then the player must name a new Lieutenant, 
without Order expenditure. The identity of this new Lieutenant is 
also Open Information. It is compulsory that this Lieutenant be a 
Model or a Marker placed on the game table. 
KEY OPS
The Key Ops is a special tactics operator with unique training to 
conduct multi-domain reconnaissance and combat across the 
full spectrum of conflicts. 
At the end of the Deployment Phase, in Initiative order, players 
must declare which Trooper from their Army List is their Key 
Ops. 
The Trooper chosen must be always one of the models deployed 
on the game table. Players are not allowed to choose Troopers 
in Hidden Deployment or in Marker state. 
This Trooper must always be on the game table as a Model 
and not as a Marker (Camouflaged, Holoecho…). Also, Irregular 
Troops and those whose Troop Type is REM or VH are not 
eligible to be Key Ops. 
The Key Ops possesses the Dodge (+3) and Tactical Awareness 
Special Skills, even if those are not listed on their Unit Profile. 
These Special Skills are not cumulative, if the Trooper already 
has them, then they are not applied. 
The Key Ops is identified with a Player A or B Marker. 
KILLING  
Troopers are considered Killed by the adversary when they 
enter Dead State, or they are in a Null State at the end of the 
game. 
Troopers that have not been deployed on the game table, as a 
Model or Marker, at the end of the game will be considered to be 
Killed by the adversary. 
The Key Ops counts as Killing a target if they cause the target 
to be in a Null State at the end of the game, or if they cause the 
loss of one or more Wounds/STR points during the Order in 
which the target enters Dead State. 
A Lieutenant is considered Killed if they were a Lieutenant at 
any time during the game, and they either enter Dead State or 
are in a Null State at the end of the game.
NO QUARTER 
In this scenario, the Retreat! rules are not applied. 
HVT AND CLASSIFIED DECK NOT USED

SCENARIO SPECIAL RULES  
QUADRANTS (ZO)   
At the end of each Game Round, but not before, the table is 
divided into four Quadrants as seen on the map. Each player 
then checks how many Quadrants they are dominating and 
counts their Objective Points. 
In this scenario each Quadrant is a Zone of Operations (ZO). 
DOMINATE ZO 
A Zone of Operations (ZO) is Dominated by a player if they have 
more Victory Points than the adversary inside the area. Only 
Troopers represented by Models or Markers (Camouflaged, 
Shasvastii-Embryo...) count, as well as Proxies and Peripheral 
Troops. Troops in a Null State do not count. Tokens representing 
weapons or pieces of equipment (like Mines or Deployable 
Repeaters), fake Holoechoes, and any Token that does not 
represent a Trooper does not count either. 
A Trooper is inside a Zone of Operations when more than half 
the Trooper’s base is inside that ZO. 
SHASVASTII 
Troopers possessing the Shasvastii Special Skill that are inside 
a Zone of Operations count while they are in the Unconscious 
State or any non-Null State.
BAGGAGE 
Troopers possessing the Baggage piece of Equipment that are 
inside a Zone of Operations and in a non-Null State provide an 
additional 20 Victory Points for Dominating the ZO.
CONSOLES 
There are 4 Consoles, placed on the center of each Quadrant 
(See map). 
Each Console must be represented by a Console A Token or by 
a scenery piece of the same diameter (such as the Consoles of 
the ITS Objective Pack Alpha, the Human Consolesby Micro Art 
Studio, the Tech Consoles by Warsenal or the Comlink Console 
by Customeeple).
HACK CONSOLES

REQUIREMENTS 
 
►Only Specialist Troops can declare this Skill.	
 
 
►The Specialist Troop must be in Silhouette contact with a Console. 
EFFECTS 
 
►Allows the Specialist Troop to make a Normal WIP Roll to Hack the 
Console.
 
►If the roll is failed, this can be repeated as many times as necessary, each 
time spending the corresponding Short Skill and making the roll. 
 
►A Hacked Console can be Hacked again by the other player applying the 
same procedure. In this case, both players will count that Console as 
Hacked.
 
►Player A and Player B Tokens can be used to mark the Hacked Consoles. It 
is recommended each player uses a different kind of Tokens.
SPECIALIST TROOPS 
For the purposes of this scenario, only Hackers, Doctors, 
Engineers, Forward Observers, Paramedics, and Troopers 
possessing the Chain of Command or the Specialist Operative 
Special Skill are considered Specialist Troops.
Hackers, Doctors, and Engineers cannot make use of Repeaters 
or Peripheral (Servant) Models to perform tasks reserved for 
Specialist Troops.
59
OPERATIONAL LEARNING
When a Specialist Troop performs a Skill with the Scenario 
Label that requires a WIP Roll and fails, they benefit from the 
following MODs in subsequent Orders:
	
^ In the second consecutive Order, the Trooper applies a 
+3 MOD to the WIP Roll required for that Scenario Skill.
	
^ In the third consecutive Order—and subsequent Orders— 
the Trooper applies +3 and +1SD MODs to the WIP Roll 
required for that Scenario Skill.
	
^ These MODs are cumulative with any other MOD that 
applies to Skills with the Scenario Label.  
IMPORTANT:
These MODs only apply to Rolls made in consecutive 
Orders by the same Trooper for the same Scenario Skill, 
with the same target, with no interruptions, or Orders spent 
on other Troopers:
	
^ If the Trooper passes the Roll, the sequence resets.
	
^ If the Trooper do not declare that Scenario Skill, the 
sequence resets. 
	
^ If the Trooper declare the same Skill, but on a different 
target, the sequence resets. 
	
^ If an Order is spent on any other Trooper, the sequence 
resets.
	
^ Only one sequence can be applied per Trooper and per 
Scenario-labelled Skill at a time.
KEY OPS
The Key Ops is a special tactics operator with unique training to 
conduct multi-domain reconnaissance and combat across the 
full spectrum of conflicts. 
At the end of the Deployment Phase, in Initiative order, players 
must declare which Trooper from their Army List is their Key 
Ops. The Trooper chosen must be always one of the models 
deployed on the game table. Players are not allowed to choose 
Troopers in Hidden Deployment or in Marker state. This Trooper 
must always be on the game table as a Model and not as a 
Marker (Camouflaged, Holoecho…). Also, Irregular Troops and 
those whose Troop Type is REM or VH are not eligible to be Key 
Ops. 
The Key Ops possesses the Dodge (+3) and Tactical Awareness 
Special Skills, even if those are not listed on their Unit Profile. 
These Special Skills are not cumulative, if the Trooper already 
has them, then they are not applied. 
The Key Ops is identified with a Player A or B Marker. 
DOMINANT KEY OPS 
Players who have their Key Ops in any non-Null State in a ZO 
Dominated by them, have a Dominant Key Ops.
HVT AND CLASSIFIED DECK NOT USED 
In this scenario, the HVT Model and Secure HVT rules are not 
applied. Players will not deploy the HVT Model on the game 
table and they will not use the Classified Deck in this scenario.
END OF THE MISSION 
This scenario has a limited time frame, so it will automatically 
finish at the end of the third Game Round.
If one of the players starts their Active Turn in a Retreat! 
situation, the game will end at the end of that Turn.

There are 2 Communication Antennas on the central line of the 
table. 
They are placed 12 inches from the table edges in 300/350/400 
point games, 8 inches in 200/250 point games, and 4 inches 
in 150 point games. Each Communication Antenna must 
be represented by a Transmission Antenna Token (TRANS.

REQUIREMENTS 
 
►Only Specialist Troops can declare this Skill.
 
►The Specialist Troop must be in Silhouette contact with a Communication

EFFECTS 
 
►Allows the Specialist Troop to make a Normal WIP Roll to Activate a 
Communication Antenna.
 
►If the roll is failed, this can be repeated as many times as necessary, each 
time spending the corresponding Short Skill and making the roll.
 
►An Activated Communication Antenna can be Activated again by the other 
player, applying the same procedure. In this situation, the Communication 
Antenna is no longer Activated by the adversary.
 
►Player A and Player B Tokens can be used to mark the Activated 
Communication Antenna. It is recommended each player uses a different 
kind of Tokens.
CONTROL A COMMUNICATION ANTENNA  
A Communication Antenna is Controlled by a player as long 
as that player is the only one with at least one Trooper (as a 
Model, not a Marker) in Silhouette contact with it. So there 
cannot be any enemy Troopers in Silhouette contact with the 
Communication Antenna. Models in a Null State cannot do either.

There is 1 Tech-Coffin placed in the center of the table. 
The Tech-Coffin must be represented by a Tech-Coffin Token or 
with a scenery piece of the same diameter (such as the Tech-
Coffin of the ITS Objective Pack Alpha, the Stasis Coffins by 
Warsenal or the Cryo Pods by Customeeple). 
CONTROL THE TECH-COFFIN  
The Tech-Coffin is Controlled by a player as long as that player 
is the only one with at least one Trooper (as a Model, not a 
Marker) in Silhouette contact with it. So there cannot be any 
enemy Troopers in Silhouette contact with the Tech-Coffin. 
Models in a Null State cannot do either. 
SPECIALIST TROOPS 
For the purposes of this scenario, only Hackers, Doctors, 
Engineers, Forward Observers, Paramedics, and Troopers 
possessing the Chain of Command or the Specialist Operative 
Special Skill are considered Specialist Troops.
Hackers, Doctors, and Engineers cannot make use of Repeaters 
or Peripheral (Servant) Models to perform tasks reserved for 
Specialist Troops. 
62
OPERATIONAL LEARNING
When a Specialist Troop performs a Skill with the Scenario 
Label that requires a WIP Roll and fails, they benefit from the 
following MODs in subsequent Orders:
In the second consecutive Order, the Trooper applies a +3 MOD 
to the WIP Roll required for that Scenario Skill.
In the third consecutive Order—and subsequent Orders—the 
Trooper applies +3 and +1SD MODs to the WIP Roll required for 
that Scenario Skill.
These MODs are cumulative with any other MOD that applies to 
Skills with the Scenario Label. 
IMPORTANT:
These MODs only apply to Rolls made in consecutive 
Orders by the same Trooper for the same Scenario Skill, 
with the same target, with no interruptions, or Orders spent 
on other Troopers:
If the Trooper passes the Roll, the sequence resets.
If the Trooper do not declare that Scenario Skill, the 
sequence resets. 
If the Trooper declares the same Skill, but with a different 
target, the sequence resets. 
If an Order is spent on any other Trooper, the sequence 
resets.
Only one sequence can be applied per Trooper and per 
Scenario-Labelled Skill at a time.
ACTIVE LIEUTENANT 
At the end of the game, a Lieutenant is Active if they are not 
in any Null state (Unconscious, Dead, Sepsitorized…), Isolated 
State, or any Immobilized State.
HVT AND CLASSIFIED DECK NOT USED 
In this scenario, the HVT Model and Secure HVT rules are not 
applied. Players will not deploy the HVT Model on the game 
table and they will not use the Classified Deck in this scenario.
END OF THE MISSION 
This scenario has a limited time frame, so it will automatically 
finish at the end of the third Game Round.
If one of the players starts their Active Turn in a Retreat! 
situation, the game will end at the end of that Turn.
63
RESILIENCE OPERATIONS 
This tournament format is a new and different way to play games. It will test the resilience of the players and their 
capacity to overcome unexpected difficulties. 
As Official Events, all Tournaments must comply with the Basic Rules of ITS; with the exception that they do not use the ITS 
scenarios nor the Classified Deck. Players must use the Tactical Objectives Deck and the Battle Conditions Deck. 
TACTICAL OBJECTIVES
The Tactical Objectives are objectives a player can accomplish to 
get Objective Points.
Each Tactical Objective provides up to 3 Objective Points, as 
listed in the special conditions of each objective.
Each Tactical Objective only provides its Objective Points once 
per game.
An Objective is accomplished when the player has got at least 1 
Objective Point from it.
At the end of the game, having accomplished more Tactical 
Objectives than the adversary gives 1 extra Objective Point.
BATTLE CONDITIONS
Battle Conditions are the particular circumstances in which the 
fight happens. They establish modifiers, bonuses or penalties 
throughout the game that will test the tactical and adaptive 
abilities of the players
TACTICAL OBJECTIVES 
AND BATTLE CONDITIONS 
SELECTION
TACTICAL OBJECTIVES
Players have only one way of choosing the Tactical Objectives, 
with the Tactical Objectives Deck.
Players draw and select their Tactical Objectives after learning 
what faction their opponent will be playing with, but always 
before choosing one of the two Army Lists shown to the 
tournament organizer.
Each player must shuffle their own Tactical Objective Deck in 
front of their opponent, draw four cards, and discard one of 
them. 
Tactical Objectives only apply to the player who drew and 
selected them, and are Private Information until the end of the 
game unless otherwise specified. 
Once the Tactical Objectives have been drawn and selected, 
players can spend one Command Token to discard one of their 
Tactical Objectives and draw a new one. 
At the beginning of the first Game Round, both players must 
choose one of their Tactical Objectives, and then reveal it at the 
same time as the other player. If a player has “Priority Target” 
among their Tactical Objectives, they must choose it to be 
revealed.
At the beginning of the next Game Rounds, both players must 
choose another of their Tactical Objectives, and then reveal it at 
the same time as the other player.
The player must keep their Tactical Objective cards and show 
them to their opponent at the end of the game.
BATTLE CONDITIONS
Players have only one way of choosing the Battle Conditions, 
with the Battle Conditions Deck.
Each Player draw and select their Battle Conditions after the 
Initiative Roll, but always before the Deployment Phase.
Each player must shuffle their own Battle Conditions Deck in 
front of their opponent, draw two cards, and discard one of 
them. In Initiative order, players show their cards and perform 
the necessary decisions or placement of elements specified on 
the Battle Conditions card. 
If both players have the same Battle Condition, the player that 
has the second Player Turn must discard their card, draw a new 
one from the Battle Conditions Deck, and apply the new card.
Battle Conditions last for the whole game and affect both 
players.
If there is more than one Movement Bonus granted by a Battle 
Condition, only one of them will apply.

END OF THE MISSION 
This scenario has a limited time frame, so it will automatically 
finish at the end of the third Game Round. 
If one of the players starts their Active Turn in a Retreat! 
situation, the game will end at the end of that Turn.
TACTICAL ELEMENTS  
Tactical Elements are those pieces of Equipment, weaponry, 
individuals, systems, etc. that the Troopers have to interact in a 
scenario. They are listed below. 
In a Resilience Operations game, players deploy all the Tactical 
Elements except the F-13 Defensive Turrets, which are placed 
on the game table only if a Battle Condition card specifies it. 
BEACONS
Before the Deployment Phase, each player must place two 
Beacons totally inside their Deployment Zone, in Silhouette 
contact with any point of its edge, as shown on the map. 
The player that kept Deployment places their Beacons first.
A Beacon can only be damaged with Weapons possessing the 
Anti-materiel Trait.
If a Beacon’s Structure Attribute is reduced to 0 or below, it is 
Destroyed and removed from the game table.
The Beacons can be targeted by the Engineer Special Skill or the 
GizmoKit piece of Equipment. 
It is not allowed to deploy in Silhouette contact with a Beacon.
The Beacons must be represented by a Beacon Token (BEACON) 
or by a scenery piece of the same diameter (such as the Beacon 
of the ITS Objectives Pack Alpha, the Tactical Beacons by Micro 
Art Studio, the Tracking Beacons by Warsenal or the Mark One 
Beacons by Customeeple).

HVTS
The HVTs follow the Civilian Rules that can be found in the ITS 
document. The sole exception is how the HVTs are placed on the 
game table.
Before the Deployment Phase, each player must place four 
HVTs totally inside the area extending four inches from their 
Deployment Zone. 
The player that kept Deployment places their HVTs first.
It is not allowed to deploy in Silhouette contact with an HVT.

Each Trooper possesses a Beeper. If the Trooper is a Specialist 
Trooper, then they will have an extra Beeper. 
To place a Beeper, the Trooper must declare the Place Deployable 
Skill. 
Beepers cannot be placed as part of a Coordinated Order. 
Beepers can be damaged by Attacks.
If a Beeper’s Structure Attribute is reduced to 0 or below, it is 
Destroyed and removed from the game table.
The Beepers must be represented by Player A or Player B Tokens 
or by Models or pieces of scenery with the same Silhouette value.

OBJECTIVES
Before the Deployment Phase, each player must place three 
Objectives totally inside the area extending eight inches from 
the central line to his/her half of the game table.
The player that kept Deployment places their Objectives first.
It is not allowed to deploy in Silhouette contact with an Objective.
Each Objective must be represented by an Objective Token 
(OBJECTIVE) or by a scenery piece of the same diameter (such 
as the Objective of the ITS Objectives Pack or the Alpha Info 
Hubs by Micro Art Studio).
F-13 DEFENSIVE TURRET 
The F-13 Defensive Turrets are Deployable Weapons, reacting with 
BS Attack or CC Attack to any Order declared by an active Enemy 
Model (but not Markers) in LOF or in Silhouette contact. 
When the STR Attribute value of an F-13 Defensive Turret is 0 or 
less, it is removed from the game table.
The F-13 Defensive Turrets must be represented by a Defensive 
Turret A /B Token or by a Model or piece of scenery with the same 
Silhouette value (for example Turrets from the ITS Objectives Pack 
Alpha).

RESILIENCE OPERATIONS GLOSSARY 
CONTROL
A Tactical Element is Controlled by a player as long as that 
player is the only one with at least one Trooper (as a Model, not 
a Marker) in Silhouette contact with it. So there cannot be any 
enemy Troopers in Silhouette contact with the Tactical Element. 
Models in a Null State cannot do either.
DOMINATE
A Quadrant or Sector is Dominated by a player if they have 
more Victory Points than the adversary inside the area. 
A Trooper is inside when more than half the Trooper’s base is 
inside that area.
Only Troopers represented by Models or Markers (Camouflaged, 
Shasvastii-Embryo, Seed-Embryo…) count, as well as Proxies 
and Peripheral Troopers. Troopers in a Null State do not count. 
Tokens representing weapons or pieces of equipment (like 
Mines or Deployable Repeaters), fake Holoechoes, and any 
Token that does not represent a Trooper does not count either.
Troopers possessing the Baggage piece of Equipment that are 
inside a Quadrant or Sector and in a non-Null State provide an 
additional 20 Victory Points for Dominating that area. 
KILLING 
Troopers are considered Killed by the adversary when they 
enter Dead State, or they are in a Null State at the end of the 
game.
Troopers that have not been deployed on the game table, as a 
Model or Marker, at the end of the game will be considered to be 
Killed by the adversary.
SUBJUGATE
A Quadrant or Sector is Subjugated by a player as long as that 
player is the only one with at least one Trooper (as a Model, 
not a Marker) inside the area. So there cannot be any enemy 
Troopers inside the Quadrant or Sector. Models in a Null State 
cannot do either.
A Trooper is inside a Quadrant or Sector when more than half 
the Trooper’s base is inside that area.
CAPTURE
Some Tactical Objectives require Troopers to Capture Tactical 
Elements. The Capture Skill allows Troopers to Capture and then 
carry a Tactical Element. 
CAPTURE TACTICAL ELEMENT
SHORT SKILL
Attack
REQUIREMENTS
The Trooper must be in one of the following situations:
 
►Be in Silhouette contact with a Model in a Null State who has a Tactical 
Element.
 
►Be in Silhouette contact with an allied Trooper with a Tactical Element.
 
►Be in Silhouette contact with a Tactical Element that is not being carried.
 EFFECTS
 
►Without the need for a Roll, the Trooper Captures the Tactical Element.
 
►Troopers must follow the Common Rules of Captured Tactical Elements.
COMMON RULES OF CAPTURED TACTICAL ELEMENTS
	
^ Each Model can carry a maximum of 1 Captured Tactical 
Element. 
	
^ As an exception, Troopers possessing the Baggage 
Special Skill can carry up to 2 Captured Tactical Elements.
	
^ Only Models, and not Markers (Camo, Impersonation, 
Holoechoes…), can carry Captured Tactical Elements.
	
^ Captured Tactical Element must always be kept on the 
table.
	
^ The Captured Tactical Element always remains in 
Silhouette contact with the Trooper which is carrying it.
	
^ If the Trooper carrying the Tactical Element enters or is in 
any Null State, they drop the Tactical Element. Move the 
Tactical Element slightly out of Silhouette contact with the 
Trooper
	
^ Tactical Elements that are being carried don’t block 
movement or LoF.
