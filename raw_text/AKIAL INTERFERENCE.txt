SCENARIO SPECIAL RULES 
COMMON CLASSIFIED OBJECTIVES
Both players share 2 Common Classified Objectives each Game 
Round, which are Public Information.
At the beginning of the first Game Round, each player must 
shuffle their Classified Deck in front of their opponent. Then 
each player must draw two cards, select one of them as their 
Private Classified Objective, and the other as a Common 
Classified Objective for the first Game Round. Once both players 
have selected a Common Classified Objective, they are revealed 
at the same time.
At the beginning of Game Rounds two and three, any current 
Common Classified Objective cards that have not been 
accomplished by either player are discarded. The Common 
Classified Objective cards that have been accomplished are 
moved to a separate area, so that each player can keep track 
of which cards have been accomplished. Player A and Player 
B Tokens can be used to mark which player has accomplished 
each Common Classified Objective card. It is recommended each 
player uses a different kind of Token.
Each player then draws two cards from their Classified Deck, 
chooses one as a Common Classified Objective, and discards the 
other.
Any Common Classified Objective that is checked “at the end 
of the game” or “during the game” can be accomplished at the 
end of any Player Turn. If both players accomplished the same 
Common Classified Objective in the same Round, both players 
have accomplished it. A Common Classified Objective can only 
be accomplished after it has been drawn.
If a player’s deck runs out of cards, shuffle their discard pile into 
a new deck.
PRIVATE CLASSIFIED OBJECTIVE
A Private Classified Objective cannot be used to Emit Akial 
Interference, and cannot be canceled by it.
The Private Classified Objectives are Private Information.
SIGNAL REDUNDANCY
If, upon revealing the Common Classified Objectives, both have 
the same name, the player with the first Player Turn must draw 
another card from their Classified Deck and place it as an extra 
Common Classified Objective.
Two Classified Objectives with the same name, whether 
Common or Private, can both be accomplished in the same 
Player Turn as long as they each have a different target or are 
accomplished by a different Trooper.
MULTIPLE HVTS 
Each of the players will deploy four HVTs, following the usual rules 
for deploying HVTs. Each HVT may only be used to accomplish one 
Classified Objective - once a Classified Objective targeting an HVT 
has been completed, that HVT Model is removed from the game 
table.

23
SECURE HVT OR SECURE 
TREASURE NOT USED 
In this scenario, the Secure HVT or Secure Treasure rule is not 
applied.
AKIAL ANTENNA
There is 1 Akial Antenna placed in the center of the table. 
The Akial Antenna must be represented by a Transmission 
Antenna Token (TRANS. ANTENNA) or with a scenery piece of 
the same diameter (such as the Antenna of the ITS Objective 
Pack Alpha, the Communications Array by Warsenal or the Sat 
Station Antenna by Customeeple).

REQUIREMENTS 
 
►Only Specialist Troops can declare this Skill.
 
►The Specialist Troop must be in Silhouette contact with the Akial Antenna
 
►The player has accomplished a Common Classified Objective that has any of 
those symbols: , , , .
 
►Each of those Common Classified Objective cards can only be chosen once 
for this Skill. 
 
►Each Specialist Troop can only Emit Akial Interference once per Game

If the roll is failed, this can be repeated as many times as necessary, each 
time spending the corresponding Short Skill and making the roll.
 
►When Akial Interference is Emitted, the player may cancel a Common 
Classified Objective that has been accomplished by the adversary and 
that shares a symbol with a Common Classified Objective previously 
accomplished by the player.
 
►The adversary has no longer accomplished the chosen Common 
Classified Objective card. If neither player has accomplished the card, 
discard it.
 
►Only Common Classified Objective cards that have been accomplished count 
towards the final score total, or can be used to Emit Akial Interference.
FILTER THE SIGNAL
SHORT SKILL 
Attack, Scenario
REQUIREMENTS 
 
►Only Specialist Troops can declare this Skill.
 
►The Specialist Troop must be in Silhouette contact with the Akial Antenna.
EFFECTS 
 
► Without needing to perform a Roll, the player can Filter the Signal.
 
►When Filtering the Signal, the player chooses one of the current Common 
Classified Objective cards.
 
►If any player has accomplished the chosen card, it is placed with the other

SPECIALIST TROOPS
For the purposes of this scenario, only Hackers, Doctors, 
Engineers, Forward Observers, Paramedics, and Troopers

If one of the players starts their Active Turn in a Retreat! 
situation, the game will end at the end of that Turn.
