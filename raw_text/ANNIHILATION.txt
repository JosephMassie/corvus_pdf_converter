SCENARIO SPECIAL RULES 
KILLING 
Troopers are considered Killed by the adversary when they 
enter Dead State, or they are in a Null State at the end of the 
game. 
Troopers that have not been deployed on the game table, as a 
Model or Marker, at the end of the game will be considered to be 
Killed by the adversary. 
 
NO QUARTER 
In this scenario, the Retreat! rules are not applied. 
HVT AND CLASSIFIED DECK NOT USED 
In this scenario, the HVT Model and Secure HVT rules are not 
applied. Players will not deploy the HVT Model on the game 
table and they will not use the Classified Deck in this scenario. 
END OF THE MISSION

finish at the end of the third Game Round.
