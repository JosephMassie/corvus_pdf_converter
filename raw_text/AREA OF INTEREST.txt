SCENARIO SPECIAL RULES 
COMMUNICATION ANTENNA
There is 1 Communication Antenna placed in the center of the 
table. 
The Communication Antenna must be represented by a 
Transmission Antenna Token (TRANS. ANTENNA) or with a 
scenery piece of the same diameter (such as the Antenna of 
the ITS Objective Pack Alpha, the Communications Array by 
Warsenal or the Sat Station Antenna by Customeeple).
ACTIVATE COMMUNICATION ANTENNA
SHORT SKILL 
Attack, Scenario 
REQUIREMENTS 
 
►Only Specialist Troops can declare this Skill. 
 
 
►The Specialist Troop must be in Silhouette contact with the 
Communication Antenna. 
EFFECTS 
 
►Spending one Short Skill, without needing to perform a Roll, the Specialist 
Trooper Activates the Communication Antenna. 
 
►If there are any enemy Hackers within any Areas of Interest, one of them 
can declare an ARO to oppose the Specialist Trooper. Activating the 
Communication Antenna in this situation is a Face to Face WIP Roll.
 
►If the roll is failed, this can be repeated as many times as necessary, each 
time spending the corresponding Short Skill.
 
►An Activated Communication Antenna can be Activated again by the other 
player, applying the same procedure. In this situation, the Communication 
Antenna is no longer Activated by the adversary.
 
►Player A and Player B Tokens can be used to mark the Activated 
Communication Antenna. It is recommended each player uses a different 
kind of Token.
AREA OF INTEREST
In this scenario the Areas of Interest are Zones of Operations 
(ZO), represented by Circular Templates.
There are a total of three Areas of Interest, one of which is the 
Special Area of Interest.
Before the Deployment Phase, and in Initiative order, each 
player must place their Circular Templates. They can be placed 
on any surface of the game table that is equal or larger in size 
than the Template, must be completely outside any Deployment 
Zones, and cannot overlap another Area of Interest.
The player with the first turn must place an Area of Interest and 
the Special Area of Interest, specifying which Template is the 
Special Area of Interest when placing it. The player with second 
turn places an Area of Interest.
DOMINATE ZO
A Zone of Operations (ZO) is Dominated by a player if they have 
more Victory Points than the adversary inside the area. Only 
Troopers represented by Models or Markers (Camouflaged, 
Shasvastii-Embryo...) count, as well as Proxies and Peripheral 
Troops. Troops in a Null State do not count. Tokens representing 
weapons or pieces of equipment (like Mines or Deployable 
Repeaters), fake Holoechoes, and any Token that does not 
represent a Trooper does not count either. 
A Trooper is inside a Zone of Operations when more than half 
the Trooper’s base is inside that ZO.
SHASVASTII
Troopers possessing the Shasvastii Special Skill that are inside 
a Zone of Operations count while they are in Unconscious State 
or any non-Null State.

50
BAGGAGE
Troopers possessing the Baggage piece of Equipment that are 
inside a Zone of Operations and in a non-Null State provide an 
additional 20 Victory Points for Dominating the ZO.
SPECIALIST TROOPS
For the purposes of this scenario, only Hackers, Doctors, 
Engineers, Forward Observers, Paramedics, and Troopers 
possessing the Chain of Command or the Specialist Operative 
Special Skill are considered Specialist Troops.
Hackers, Doctors, and Engineers cannot make use of Repeaters 
or Peripheral (Servant) Models to perform tasks reserved for 
Specialist Troops.
INTELCOM CARD (SUPPORT AND CONTROL) 
Before the beginning of the game, but after choosing the first 
Classified Objective, the player must inform to their adversary 
if that card will be their Classified Objective or their INTELCOM 
Card. Each player rolls a die and the one who gets the highest 
score must be the first who announces their decision to their 
adversary. The content of the card, whether the mission or the 
card numeric value, is Private Information, no matter which use 
the player has chosen for it. 
At the end of the last Game Round, when the players count 
up their points and in Initiative order, the player can use their 
INTELCOM Card in Support and Control Mode. 
Support and Control Mode: The player can add the value of the 
Support and Control Card to their Victory Points in the Zone of 
Operations (ZO) of their choice. The player must have at least 
one Trooper inside that ZO, in a non-Null State.
END OF THE MISSION 
This scenario has a limited time frame, so it will automatically 
finish at the end of the third Game Round.
If one of the players starts their Active Turn in a Retreat! 
situation, the game will end at the end of that Turn.
