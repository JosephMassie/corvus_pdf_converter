SCENARIO SPECIAL RULES
TRACKING BEACON 
There is 1 Tracking Beacon placed in the center of the table.
The Tracking Beacon must be represented by a Beacon Token 
(BEACON) or by a scenery piece of the same diameter (such 
as the Beacon from the ITS Objectives Pack Alpha, the Tactical 
Beacons by Micro Art Studio, the Tracking Beacons by Warsenal 
or the Mark One Beacons by Customeeple).
RELOCATE THE TRACKING BEACON
SHORT SKILL
Attack, Scenario.
REQUIREMENTS
 
►Only Specialist Troops can declare this Skill.
 
► The Specialist Troop must be in Silhouette contact with the Tracking 
Beacon.
 
►Each Specialist Troop can only declare this Skill once per Game Round.
EFFECTS
 
►Spending one Short Skill, without needing to perform a Roll, the player 
can Relocate the Tracking Beacon.
 
►Place the Tracking Beacon anywhere within 4 inches of its previous 
position.
COMMON RULES 
OF THE TRACKING BEACON 
When moving the Tracking Beacon, the following rules must be 
followed:
 
^ The final position of the Tracking Beacon must be fully 
supported by the surface it is placed on, and it cannot be 
placed on a vertical surface.
 
^ It must be possible to draw a path between the Tracking 
Beacon’s starting and final positions. The path cannot be 
blocked by an impassable obstacle (for example a wall 
of infinite height, a closed door or sealed room...) or a 
gap too small for the diameter of the Tracking Beacon to 
pass through.
 
^ The Tracking Beacon is placed in its final position at the 
Conclusion of the Order. 
CONTROL THE TRACKING BEACON
At the end of each Game Round, the Tracking Beacon is 
Controlled by a player as long as that player is the only one with 
at least one Trooper (as a Model, not a Marker) in Silhouette 
contact with it. So there cannot be any enemy Troopers in 
Silhouette contact with the Tracking Beacon. Models in a Null 
State cannot do either.
CONSOLES
There are two Consoles, placed on the central line of the 
game table. They are placed 12 inches from the table edges in 
300/350/400 point games, 8 inches in 200/250 point games, 
and 6 inches in 150 point games (see map).
Each Console must be represented by a Console A Token or by a 
scenery piece of the same diameter (such as the Consoles from 
the ITS Objectives Pack Alpha, the Human Consoles by Micro Art 
Studio, the Tech Consoles by Warsenal or the Comlink Console 
by Customeeple).
ACTIVATE CONSOLE
SHORT SKILL
Attack, Scenario.
REQUIREMENTS
 
►Only Specialist Troops can declare this Skill.
 
►The Specialist Troop must be in Silhouette contact with the Console. 
 
►The Tracking Beacon cannot be in Silhouette contact with a Trooper.
 
►Each Specialist Troop can only successfully Activate a Console once per 
Game Round. 
EFFECTS
 
►Allows the Specialist Troop to make a Normal WIP Roll to Activate the 
Console. If the roll is failed, this can be repeated as many times as 
necessary, each time spending the corresponding Short Skill and making 
the roll.
 
►Once you successfully have Activated the Console, you must choose and 
perform one of the following actions:
 
►Nudge the Tracking Beacon: Place the Tracking Beacon anywhere 
within 2 inches of its current position. 
 
►Magnetize the Tracking Beacon: Place the Tracking Beacon within 6 
inches of its current position and directly towards the center of the 
game table. This action cannot be used to move the Tracking Beacon 
beyond the center of the table. 

26
NO QUARTER
In this scenario, the Retreat! rules are not applied.
END OF THE MISSION
This scenario has a limited time frame, so it will automatically 
finish at the end of the third Game Round.
CONTROL THE CONSOLE
At the end of each Game Round, a Console is Controlled by a 
player as long as that player is the only one with at least one 
Trooper (as a Model, not a Marker) in Silhouette contact with it. 
So there cannot be any enemy Troopers in Silhouette contact 
with the Console. Models in a Null State cannot do either.
SPECIALIST TROOPS
For the purposes of this scenario, only Hackers, Doctors, 
Engineers, Forward Observers, Paramedics, and Troopers 
possessing the Chain of Command or the Specialist Operative 
Special Skill are considered Specialist Troops.
Hackers, Doctors, and Engineers cannot make use of Repeaters 
or Peripheral (Servant) Models to perform tasks reserved for 
Specialist Troops.
