SCENARIO SPECIAL RULES 
PROTOTYPE
There are 2 Prototypes, 1 belonging to each player, on the 
central line of the table. They are placed 12 inches from the 
table edges in 300/350/400 point games, 8 inches in 200/250 
point games, and 6 inches in 150 point games. 
Before the Deployment Phase, the player with the second Turn 
decides which Prototype belongs to which player.
Each Prototype must be represented by an Objective Token or 
by a scenery piece of the same diameter (such as the Objective 
of the ITS Objectives Pack or the Alpha Info Hubs by Micro Art 
Studio).
In this scenario the Prototypes have a Profile and can be 
targeted.

FIXED CC ROLL= 8, GIZMOKIT (PH=9)
AUTOMATED DEFENSE SYSTEM (ADS) 
Every Prototype is equipped with an ADS to avoid tampering 
with the Prototype system. Any CC Attack made against 
the Prototype will trigger a CC Attack in reaction, which 
automatically rolls an 8. Any CC Attack against the Prototype is 
automatically a Face to Face Roll. No MODs can be applied to the 
attacker’s CC Attribute. 
If the ADS’s Roll of 8 is a success, the attacker suffers a Stun 
Ammunition hit, forcing them to make one Saving Roll against 
BTS, with PS 5. The Immunity (Enhanced) and Immunity (BTS) 
Special Skills are not effective against this hit.
DESTROY THE PROTOTYPES 
A Prototype can only be damaged by CC Attacks with Weapons 
possessing the Anti-materiel Trait, or by placing D-Charges. 
The Prototype is Destroyed and must be removed from the 
gaming table when it suffers a number of Wounds equal or 
higher than its STR Attribute value. 
The Prototype can be the target of the Engineer Special Skill or 
the GizmoKit piece of Equipment
Attacks cannot be declared against Prototypes during the first 
Game Round, with the exception of Pick Up Prototype.
PICK UP PROTOTYPE
SHORT SKILL 
Attack, Scenario
REQUIREMENTS 
The Trooper must be in one of the following situations: 
 
►Be in Silhouette contact with an allied Trooper in a Normal State with an 
Enemy Prototype.
 
►Be in Silhouette contact with an Enemy Prototype Token that is not being 
carried.
EFFECTS 
 
►Spending one Short Skill, without needing a Roll, any Trooper can pick up 
an Enemy Prototype in any of the situations previously mentioned. 
 
►The Trooper must follow the Common Rules of Prototypes.
COMMON RULES OF PROTOTYPES 
 
^ A Trooper carrying a Prototype cannot declare Move as 
the second Basic Short Skill of an Order. As an exception, 
Troopers possessing the Baggage Special Skill can 
declare Move as the second Basic Short Skill of the 
Order.
 
^ Only Models, and not Markers, (Camo, Impersonation, 
Holoechoes…) can carry the Prototypes.
 
^ The Prototype Token must always be kept on the table.
 
^ The Prototype Token always remains in Silhouette 
contact with the Trooper which is carrying it.
 
^ If the Trooper carrying the Prototype enters or is in any 
Null State, they drop the Prototype. Move the Prototype 
slightly out of Silhouette contact with the Trooper
 
^ Prototype Tokens do not block movement or LoF.
CAPTURING ENEMY PROTOTYPE 
A Enemy Prototype is Captured by a player if, at the end of the 
game, that player has a Model, but not a Marker, carrying it. That 
Trooper cannot be in a Null State or in Silhouette contact with 
any enemy Model.

29
PANOPLIES
There are a total of 2 Panoplies, placed in different halves of the 
table, each in the middle of the front edge of the Deployment 
Zone. (see map)
Each Panoply must be represented by an Objective Token or by a 
scenery piece of the same diameter (such as the Objective of the 
ITS Objectives Pack or the Alpha Info Hubs by Micro Art Studio).
USE PANOPLIES
SHORT SKILL
Attack, Scenario.
REQUIREMENTS
 
►The Trooper must be in Silhouette contact with a Panoply. 
EFFECTS
 
►By succeeding at a WIP Roll, a Trooper gains the D-Charges weapon or, 
if their player prefers, makes a Roll on the Panoply Chart to obtain one 
different weapon or piece of equipment. Once a success has been rolled, 
that Trooper cannot use this Panoply again.
 
►Troopers possessing the Booty Special Skill, or any other Skill which 
specifies so, don’t need to make the WIP Roll. 
 
►A Trooper in Silhouette contact with this piece of scenery may spend one 
Short Skill of an Order to cancel their Unloaded State.  
 
►If a Trooper rolls a weapon or piece of equipment they already have, they 
can repeat the roll on the Panoply Chart.

END OF THE MISSION
This scenario has a limited time frame, so it will automatically 
finish at the end of the third Game Round.
If one of the players starts their Active Turn in a Retreat! 
situation, the game will end at the end of that Turn.
