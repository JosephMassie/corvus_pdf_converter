SCENARIO SPECIAL RULES 
DEAD ZONE
There are two Dead Zones, one in each half of the game table. 
The Dead Zones are the areas between the Deployment Zones.
In this scenario each Dead Zone is a Zone of Operations (ZO).
DOMINATE ZO 
A Zone of Operations (ZO) is Dominated by a player if they have 
more Victory Points than the adversary inside the area. Only 
Troopers represented by Models or Markers (Camouflaged, 
Shasvastii-Embryo...) count, as well as Proxies and Peripheral 
Troops. Troops in a Null State do not count. Tokens representing 
weapons or pieces of equipment (like Mines or Deployable 
Repeaters), fake Holoechoes, and any Token that does not 
represent a Trooper does not count either. 
A Trooper is inside a Zone of Operations when more than half 
the Trooper’s base is inside that ZO.
SHASVASTII
Troopers possessing the Shasvastii Special Skill that are inside 
a Zone of Operations count while they are in the Shasvastii-
Embryo State or any non-Null State.
BAGGAGE 
Troopers possessing the Baggage piece of Equipment that are 
inside a Zone of Operations and in a non-Null State provide an 
additional 20 Victory Points for Dominating the ZO.
ANTENNAS
There are 2 Antennas placed on the central line of the table. 
They are placed 12 inches from the table edges in 300/350/400 
point games, 8 inches in 200/250 point games, and 6 inches in 
150 point games (see map).
The Antennas must be represented by Transmission Antenna 
Tokens (TRANS. ANTENNA) or with scenery pieces of the same 
diameter (such as the Antenna of the ITS Objective Pack Alpha, 
the Communications Array by Warsenal or the Sat Station 
Antenna by Customeeple).
