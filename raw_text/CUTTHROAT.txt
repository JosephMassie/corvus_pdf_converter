SCENARIO SPECIAL RULES 
REINFORCED TACTICAL LINK 
In this scenario the Loss of Lieutenant rule does not apply. 
In this mission, the identity of the Lieutenant is always Open 
Information. The player must indicate which Marker is the 
Lieutenant if it is in a Marker State (Camouflaged, Decoy...) or 
which Markers are the Lieutenant in the case of a Holoprojector. 
The Lieutenant must be placed on the game table at the 
beginning of the first Game Round, either as a Model or as a 
Marker. Players may not deploy their Lieutenants in Hidden 
Deployment State. 
If the player lacks a Lieutenant during the Tactical Phase of their 
Active Turn because this Trooper was not deployed or because 
it is in the Isolated State or any Null State (Unconscious, Dead, 
Sepsitorized…), then the player must name a new Lieutenant, 
without Order expenditure. The identity of this new Lieutenant is 
also Open Information. It is compulsory that this Lieutenant be a 
Model or a Marker placed on the game table. 
KEY OPS
The Key Ops is a special tactics operator with unique training to 
conduct multi-domain reconnaissance and combat across the 
full spectrum of conflicts. 
At the end of the Deployment Phase, in Initiative order, players 
must declare which Trooper from their Army List is their Key 
Ops. 
The Trooper chosen must be always one of the models deployed 
on the game table. Players are not allowed to choose Troopers 
in Hidden Deployment or in Marker state. 
This Trooper must always be on the game table as a Model 
and not as a Marker (Camouflaged, Holoecho…). Also, Irregular 
Troops and those whose Troop Type is REM or VH are not 
eligible to be Key Ops. 
The Key Ops possesses the Dodge (+3) and Tactical Awareness 
Special Skills, even if those are not listed on their Unit Profile. 
These Special Skills are not cumulative, if the Trooper already 
has them, then they are not applied. 
The Key Ops is identified with a Player A or B Marker. 
KILLING 
Troopers are considered Killed by the adversary when they 
enter Dead State, or they are in a Null State at the end of the 
game. 
Troopers that have not been deployed on the game table, as a 
Model or Marker, at the end of the game will be considered to be 
Killed by the adversary. 
The Key Ops counts as Killing a target if they cause the target 
to be in a Null State at the end of the game, or if they cause the 
loss of one or more Wounds/STR points during the Order in 
which the target enters Dead State. 
A Lieutenant is considered Killed if they were a Lieutenant at 
any time during the game, and they either enter Dead State or 
are in a Null State at the end of the game.
NO QUARTER 
In this scenario, the Retreat! rules are not applied. 
HVT AND CLASSIFIED DECK NOT USED 
In this scenario, the HVT Model and Secure HVT rules are not 
applied. Players will not deploy the HVT Model on the game 
table and they will not use the Classified Deck in this scenario.
END OF THE MISSION 
This scenario has a limited time frame, so it will automatically 
finish at the end of the third Game Round.
