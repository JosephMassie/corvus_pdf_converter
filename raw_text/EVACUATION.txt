SCENARIO SPECIAL RULES 
CIVILIANS
There are a total of four Civilians on the game table, two of them 
in each table half. Each Civilian is placed 16 inches from the rear 
of the Deployment Zone and 6 inches from the edge of the table. 
(see the map). 
For 150 point games, the Civilians are placed 12 inches from the 
rear of the Deployment Zone and 6 inches from the edges of the 
table. (see the map).
The Civilians cannot be placed on top of or inside of any Scenery 
Item or Building, always deploying them in accessible locations 
on the table. Scenery placement must facilitate this.
Players can use any Model from the Infinity or the Infinity 
Bootleg range, preferably those designated as HVT or as a 
Civilian. Good examples of this are the O-12 High Commissioner, 
the Tohaa Diplomat, Go-Go Marlene, the Fusilier Angus, the TAG 
Pilots, the VIP Executive or the HAZMAT A1 Specialist. Players 
can also use the Player A and Player B Tokens to identify or 
even represent their Civilians.
MULTIPLE HVTS
Each of the players deploys two HVTs, following the usual rules 
for deploying HVTs.
EXTRACTION CONSOLES
There are 2 Extraction Consoles, placed on the central line of the 
table. They are placed 16 inches from the edges of the table in 
300/350/400 point games, 12 inches in 200/250 point games, 
and 8 inches in 150 point games (see map). 
Each Console must be represented by a Console A Token or by 
a scenery piece of the same diameter (such as the Consoles of 
the ITS Objective Pack Alpha, the Human Consoles by Micro Art 
Studio, the Tech Consoles by Warsenal or the Comlink Console 
by Customeeple).
ACTIVATE EXTRACTION CONSOLE
SHORT SKILL
Attack, Scenario.
REQUIREMENTS
 
►Only Specialist Troops can declare this Skill.
 
►The Specialist Troop must be in Silhouette contact with an Extraction 
Console.
 
►The Specialist Troop must be CivEvacing a Civilian or an Enemy HVT. 
 
►This Skill cannot be declared during the first Game Round.
EFFECTS
 
►Allows the Specialist Troop to make a Normal WIP Roll to Activate an 
Extraction Console.
If the roll is failed, this can be repeated as many times as necessary, each 
time spending the corresponding Short Skill and making the roll.
 
►If the roll is successful, the player chooses one of the Specialist Troop’s 
CivEvaced Civilians or Enemy HVTs. The chosen Civilian or HVT has been 
Extracted, and is removed from the game table.

SPECIALIST TROOPS
For the purposes of this scenario, only Hackers, Doctors, 
Engineers, Forward Observers, Paramedics, and Troopers 
possessing the Chain of Command or the Specialist Operative 
Special Skill are considered Specialist Troops.
Hackers, Doctors, and Engineers cannot make use of Repeaters 
or Peripheral (Servant) Models to perform tasks reserved for 
Specialist Troops.
OPERATIONAL LEARNING
When a Specialist Troop performs a Skill with the Scenario 
Label that requires a WIP Roll and fails, they benefit from the 
following MODs in subsequent Orders:
 
^ In the second consecutive Order, the Trooper applies a 
+3 MOD to the WIP Roll required for that Scenario Skill.
 
^ In the third consecutive Order—and subsequent Orders— 
the Trooper applies +3 and +1SD MODs to the WIP Roll 
required for that Scenario Skill.
 
^ These MODs are cumulative with any other MOD that 
applies to Skills with the Scenario Label. 
IMPORTANT
These MODs only apply to Rolls made in consecutive 
Orders by the same Trooper for the same Scenario Skill, 
with the same target, with no interruptions, or Orders spent 
on other Troopers:
 
^ If the Trooper passes the Roll, the sequence resets.
 
^ If the Trooper do not declare that Scenario Skill, the 
sequence resets. 
 
^ If the Trooper declare the same Skill, but on a different 
target, the sequence resets. 
 
^ If an Order is spent on any other Trooper, the sequence 
resets.
 
^ Only one sequence can be applied per Trooper and per 
Scenario-labelled Skill at a time.
END OF THE MISSION
This scenario has a limited time frame, so it will automatically 
finish at the end of the third Game Round.
If one of the players starts their Active Turn in a Retreat! 
situation, the game will end at the end of that Turn.
