SCENARIO SPECIAL RULES 
BEACONS
There are a total of 2 Beacons, 1 corresponding to each player, 
placed in different halves of the table, each in the middle of the 
front edge of the Deployment Zone. (see map). 
The Enemy Beacon is the one on the edge of the enemy 
Deployment Zone.
PICK UP BEACON 
SHORT SKILL
Attack, Scenario.
REQUIREMENTS
 
► Have an Activated Console. 
Also, the Trooper must be in one of the following situations: 
 
►The Trooper is in Silhouette contact with a friendly Trooper in a Normal State 
that has an Enemy Beacon. 
 
►The Trooper is in Silhouette contact with an Enemy Beacon which has no 
enemy Troops in a non-Null State in contact with it.
EFFECTS
 
►A Trooper can pick up an Enemy Beacon in any of the situations previously 
mentioned by spending one Short Skill, without needing to perform a Roll. 
 
►The Troopers must follow the Common Rules of Beacons.
COMMON RULES OF BEACONS 
 
^ Each Model can carry a maximum of 1 Beacon. As an 
exception, Troopers possessing the Baggage Special Skill 
can carry up to 2 Beacons. 
 
^ Only Models, and not Markers, (Camouflaged, 
Impersonation, Holoechoes…) can carry the Beacons. 
 
^ The Beacon must always be kept on the table.
 
^ The Beacon always remains in Silhouette contact with the 
Trooper which is carrying it.
 
^ If the Trooper carrying the Beacon enters or is in any Null 
State, they drop the Beacon. Move the Beacon slightly out of 
Silhouette contact with the Trooper.
 
^ Beacons do not block movement or LoF. 
CONTROL AN ENEMY BEACON
An Enemy Beacon is Controlled by a player as long as that player 
is the only one with at least one Trooper (as a Model, not a Marker) 
in Silhouette contact with it. So there cannot be any enemy 
Troopers in Silhouette contact with the Beacon. Models in a Null 
State cannot do either.
CONSOLES
There are three Consoles, placed on the central line of the game 
table. One of them is in the center of the table, and the other two 
are placed 12 inches from the table edges in 300/350/400 point 
games, 8 inches in 200/250 point games, and 6 inches in 150 point 
games (see map). 
Each Console must be represented by a Console A Token or by 
a scenery piece of the same diameter (such as the Consoles of 
the ITS Objectives Pack Alpha, the Human Consoles by Micro Art 
Studio, the Tech Consoles by Warsenal or the Comlink Console by 
Customeeple). 
ACTIVATE CONSOLE 
SHORT SKILL
Attack, Scenario.
REQUIREMENTS
 
►Only Specialist Troops can declare this Skill.
 
►The Specialist Troop must be in Silhouette contact with a Console.
EFFECTS
 
►Allows the Specialist Troop to make a Normal WIP Roll to Activate a Console.
 
►If the roll is failed, this can be repeated as many times as necessary, each 
time spending the corresponding Short Skill and making the roll.
 
►An Activated Console can be Activated again by the other player, applying the 
same procedure. In this situation, the Console is no longer 
Activated by 
the adversary.
 
►Player A and Player B Tokens can be used to mark the Activated Console. It is 
recommended each player uses a different kind of Tokens.
SPECIALIST TROOPS
For the purposes of this scenario, only Hackers, Doctors, 
Engineers, Forward Observers, Paramedics, and Troopers 
possessing the Chain of Command or the Specialist Operative 
Special Skill are considered Specialist Troops.
Hackers, Doctors, and Engineers cannot make use of Repeaters 
or Peripheral (Servant) Models to perform tasks reserved for 
Specialist Troops.
END OF THE MISSION
This scenario has a limited time frame, so it will automatically 
finish at the end of the third Game Round.
If one of the players starts their Active Turn in a Retreat! situation, 
the game will end at the end of that Turn.
