LAUNCHING TOWER (ZO)
In this scenario, the Launching Tower is a Zone of Operations 
(ZO). Placed in the center of the table, it covers an area of 8 by 8 
inches. To represent the Launching Tower, we recommend using 
the Objective Room of the different Infinity Expansion Scenery 
Packs, the Objective Room by Micro Art Studio, the Command 
Bunker by Warsenal, or the Panic Room by Customeeple.
In game terms, it is considered to have walls of infinite height 
that completely block Line of Fire. It has four Wide Gates, one in 
the middle of each wall (see map). The Gates of the Launching 
Tower are open at the start of the game.
DOMINATE ZO 
A Zone of Operations is Dominated by a player if they have 
more Victory Points than the adversary inside the area. Only 
Troopers represented by Models or Markers (Camouflaged, 
Shasvastii-Embryo, …) count, as well as Proxies and Peripheral 
Troops. Troops in a Null State do not count. Tokens representing 
weapons or pieces of equipment (like Mines or Deployable 
Repeaters), fake Holoechoes, and any Token that does not 
represent a Trooper do not count either.
A Trooper is inside the ZO when more than half the Trooper’s 
base is inside that ZO.
SHASVASTII
Troopers possessing the Shasvastii Special Skill that are inside 
a Zone of Operations count while they are in Unconscious State 
or any non-Null State.
BAGGAGE
Each Trooper possessing the Baggage piece of Equipment that 
is Extracted provides an additional 20 points to the player’s 
Extracted Army Points.
Troopers possessing the Baggage piece of Equipment that are 
inside a Zone of Operations and in a non-Null State provide an 
additional 20 Victory Points for Dominating the ZO 
SCENARIO SPECIAL RULES 
ID SCANNERS 
There are 2 ID Scanners placed on the central line of the table. 
They are placed 8 inches from the table edges (4 inches in 150 
point games). 
The ID Scanners must be represented by a Tech-Coffin Token or 
with a scenery piece of the same diameter (such as the Tech-
Coffins of the ITS Objective Pack Alpha, the Stasis Coffins by 
Warsenal, or the Cryo Pods by Customeeple).

Model or Marker, at the end of the game will be considered to be 
Killed by the adversary.
