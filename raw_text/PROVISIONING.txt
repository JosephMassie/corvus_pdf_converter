SCENARIO SPECIAL RULES 
TECH-COFFINS
There are a total of 3 Tech-Coffins. One of them is placed in the 
center of the table while the other two are placed along the 
central diagonal line of the table, at 16 inches from the central 
Tech-Coffin (12 inches in 200/250 point games, and 8 inches 
in 150 point games) (see map). Each Tech-Coffin contains one 
Supply Box, except for the central Tech-Coffin which contains 
two Supply Boxes.
The Tech-Coffins must be represented by a Tech-Coffin Marker 
or with a scenery piece of the same diameter (Such as the ITS 
Objective Pack Alpha, Stasis Coffins by Warsenal or the Cryo 
Pods by Customeeple).
SUPPLY BOXES 
The Supply Boxes must be represented by a Supply Box Marker, 
or a similar scenery item (Such as the Supply Boxes of the ITS 
Objective Pack Alpha, the Tech Crates by Micro Art Studio, the 
Gang Tie Containers by Bandua Wargames, the Supply Boxes by 
Warsenal or the Cargo Crates by Customeeple)
REMEMBER
The central Tech-Coffin contains two Supply Boxes.
EXTRACT SUPPLY BOXES 
SHORT SKILL 
Attack, Scenario 
REQUIREMENTS 
 
►Only Specialist Troops can declare this Skill.
 
►The Specialist Troop must be in base contact with a Tech-Coffin.
EFFECTS 
 
►Allows the Specialist Troop to make a Normal WIP Roll to Extract and pick 
up the Supply Box, with a successful roll one SUPPLY BOX Token must be 
placed besides the Trooper. 
 
►If the roll is failed, this can be repeated as many times as necessary, each 
time spending the corresponding Short Skill and making the roll. 
 
►When all Supply Box Tokens have been Extracted from a Tech-Coffin, a 
Player A or Player B Token must be placed besides it to mark that the 
Supply Boxes have been extracted.
PICK UP SUPPLY BOXES
SHORT SKILL 
Attack, Scenario 
REQUIREMENTS 
The Trooper must be in one of the following situations:
 
►Be in Silhouette contact with an allied Trooper in a Normal State with a 
SUPPLY BOX Token.
 
►Be in Silhouette contact with a Supply Box that is not being carried.
In addition:
 
►If the SUPPLY BOX Token is in the enemy’s Safe Area, the Trooper must be 
a Specialist Troop.
EFFECTS 
 
►Spending one Short Skill, without needing a Roll, the Trooper can pick 
up a Supply Box in any of the situations previously mentioned. Place the 
Supply Box Token in Silhouette contact with the Trooper.
 
►If the Supply Box is in the enemy’s Safe Area, the Specialist Troop must 
pass a Normal WIP-3 Roll.
 
►The Trooper must follow the Common Rules of Supply Boxes.
COMMON RULES OF SUPPLY BOXES 
 
^ Each Model can carry a maximum of 1 Supply Box. As an 
exception, Models possessing the Baggage Special Skill 
can carry up to 2 Supply Boxes.
 
^ Only Models, and not Markers, (Camo, Impersonation, 
Holoechoes…) can carry the Supply Boxes.
 
^ The Supply Box Token must always be kept on the table.
 
^ The Supply Box Token always remains in Silhouette 
contact with the Trooper which is carrying it.
 
^ If the Trooper carrying the Supply Box enters or is in any 
Null State, they drop the Supply Box. Move the Supply 
Box Token slightly out of Silhouette contact with the 
Trooper.
 
^ Supply Box Tokens don’t block movement or LoF.
CONTROLLING THE SUPPLY BOXES 
A Supply Box is Controlled by a player if, at the end of the game, 
that player has a Model, but not a Marker, carrying it. That 
Trooper cannot be in a Null State or in Silhouette contact with 
any enemy Model. Supply Boxes in a player’s Safe Area are 
Controlled by that player unless an enemy Specialist Troop is 
carrying it.

47
SAFE AREA 
Each player has a Safe Area where they must deposit the 
Supply Boxes.
Before the Deployment Phase, each player must place one 
Circular Template. It can be placed on any surface of the game 
table that is equal or larger in size than the Template, must be 
completely outside any Deployment Zones, and cannot overlap 
another Safe Area.
The player that kept Deployment must place their Circular 
Template first.
Any Trooper may put down a Supply Box in a Safe Area by 
spending one Short Skill, without needing to perform a Roll. The 
Trooper must place the Supply Box totally inside the Safe Area.
Only Specialist Troops may pick up a Supply Box from the 
enemy’s Safe Area, using the Pick Up Supply Boxes Short Skill.
SPECIALIST TROOPS
For the purposes of this scenario, only Hackers, Doctors, 
Engineers, Forward Observers, Paramedics, and Troopers 
possessing the Chain of Command or the Specialist Operative 
Special Skill are considered Specialist Troops.
Hackers, Doctors, and Engineers cannot make use of Repeaters 
or Peripheral (Servant) Models to perform tasks reserved for 
Specialist Troops.
OPERATIONAL LEARNING
When a Specialist Troop performs a Skill with the Scenario 
Label that requires a WIP Roll and fails, they benefit from the 
following MODs in subsequent Orders:
 
^ In the second consecutive Order, the Trooper applies a 
+3 MOD to the WIP Roll required for that Scenario Skill.
 
^ In the third consecutive Order—and subsequent Orders— 
the Trooper applies +3 and +1SD MODs to the WIP Roll 
required for that Scenario Skill.
 
^ These MODs are cumulative with any other MOD that 
applies to Skills with the Scenario Label. 
IMPORTANT:
These MODs only apply to Rolls made in consecutive 
Orders by the same Trooper for the same Scenario Skill, 
with the same target, with no interruptions, or Orders spent 
on other Troopers:
 
^ If the Trooper passes the Roll, the sequence resets.
 
^ If the Trooper do not declare that Scenario Skill, the 
sequence resets. 
 
^ If the Trooper declare the same Skill, but on a different 
target, the sequence resets. 
 
^ If an Order is spent on any other Trooper, the sequence 
resets.
 
^ Only one sequence can be applied per Trooper and per 
Scenario-labelled Skill at a time.
END OF THE MISSION 
This scenario has a limited time frame, so it will automatically 
finish at the end of the third Game Round.
If one of the players starts their Active Turn in a Retreat! 
situation, the game will end at the end of that Turn.
