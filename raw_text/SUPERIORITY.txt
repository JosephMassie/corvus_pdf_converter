SCENARIO SPECIAL RULES 
QUADRANTS (ZO) 
At the end of each Game Round, but not before, the table is 
divided into four Quadrants as seen on the map. Each player 
then checks how many Quadrants they are dominating and 
counts their Objective Points. 
In this scenario each Quadrant is a Zone of Operations (ZO). 
DOMINATE ZO 
A Zone of Operations (ZO) is Dominated by a player if they have 
more Victory Points than the adversary inside the area. Only 
Troopers represented by Models or Markers (Camouflaged, 
Shasvastii-Embryo...) count, as well as Proxies and Peripheral 
Troops. Troops in a Null State do not count. Tokens representing 
weapons or pieces of equipment (like Mines or Deployable 
Repeaters), fake Holoechoes, and any Token that does not 
represent a Trooper does not count either. 
A Trooper is inside a Zone of Operations when more than half 
the Trooper’s base is inside that ZO. 
SHASVASTII 
Troopers possessing the Shasvastii Special Skill that are inside 
a Zone of Operations count while they are in the Unconscious 
State or any non-Null State.
BAGGAGE 
Troopers possessing the Baggage piece of Equipment that are 
inside a Zone of Operations and in a non-Null State provide an 
additional 20 Victory Points for Dominating the ZO.
CONSOLES 
There are 4 Consoles, placed on the center of each Quadrant 
(See map). 
Each Console must be represented by a Console A Token or by 
a scenery piece of the same diameter (such as the Consoles of 
the ITS Objective Pack Alpha, the Human Consolesby Micro Art 
Studio, the Tech Consoles by Warsenal or the Comlink Console 
by Customeeple).
HACK CONSOLES 
SHORT SKILL 
Attack, Scenario. 
REQUIREMENTS 
 
►Only Specialist Troops can declare this Skill. 
 
 
►The Specialist Troop must be in Silhouette contact with a Console. 
EFFECTS 
 
►Allows the Specialist Troop to make a Normal WIP Roll to Hack the 
Console.
 
►If the roll is failed, this can be repeated as many times as necessary, each 
time spending the corresponding Short Skill and making the roll. 
 
►A Hacked Console can be Hacked again by the other player applying the 
same procedure. In this case, both players will count that Console as 
Hacked.
 
►Player A and Player B Tokens can be used to mark the Hacked Consoles. It 
is recommended each player uses a different kind of Tokens.
SPECIALIST TROOPS 
For the purposes of this scenario, only Hackers, Doctors, 
Engineers, Forward Observers, Paramedics, and Troopers 
possessing the Chain of Command or the Specialist Operative 
Special Skill are considered Specialist Troops.
Hackers, Doctors, and Engineers cannot make use of Repeaters 
or Peripheral (Servant) Models to perform tasks reserved for 
Specialist Troops.

OPERATIONAL LEARNING
When a Specialist Troop performs a Skill with the Scenario 
Label that requires a WIP Roll and fails, they benefit from the 
following MODs in subsequent Orders:
 
^ In the second consecutive Order, the Trooper applies a 
+3 MOD to the WIP Roll required for that Scenario Skill.
 
^ In the third consecutive Order—and subsequent Orders— 
the Trooper applies +3 and +1SD MODs to the WIP Roll 
required for that Scenario Skill.
 
^ These MODs are cumulative with any other MOD that 
applies to Skills with the Scenario Label. 
IMPORTANT:
These MODs only apply to Rolls made in consecutive 
Orders by the same Trooper for the same Scenario Skill, 
with the same target, with no interruptions, or Orders spent 
on other Troopers:
 
^ If the Trooper passes the Roll, the sequence resets.
 
^ If the Trooper do not declare that Scenario Skill, the 
sequence resets. 
 
^ If the Trooper declare the same Skill, but on a different 
target, the sequence resets. 
 
^ If an Order is spent on any other Trooper, the sequence 
resets.
 
^ Only one sequence can be applied per Trooper and per 
Scenario-labelled Skill at a time.
KEY OPS
The Key Ops is a special tactics operator with unique training to 
conduct multi-domain reconnaissance and combat across the 
full spectrum of conflicts. 
At the end of the Deployment Phase, in Initiative order, players 
must declare which Trooper from their Army List is their Key 
Ops. The Trooper chosen must be always one of the models 
deployed on the game table. Players are not allowed to choose 
Troopers in Hidden Deployment or in Marker state. This Trooper 
must always be on the game table as a Model and not as a 
Marker (Camouflaged, Holoecho…). Also, Irregular Troops and 
those whose Troop Type is REM or VH are not eligible to be Key 
Ops. 
The Key Ops possesses the Dodge (+3) and Tactical Awareness 
Special Skills, even if those are not listed on their Unit Profile. 
These Special Skills are not cumulative, if the Trooper already 
has them, then they are not applied. 
The Key Ops is identified with a Player A or B Marker. 
DOMINANT KEY OPS 
Players who have their Key Ops in any non-Null State in a ZO 
Dominated by them, have a Dominant Key Ops.
HVT AND CLASSIFIED DECK NOT USED 
In this scenario, the HVT Model and Secure HVT rules are not 
applied. Players will not deploy the HVT Model on the game 
table and they will not use the Classified Deck in this scenario.
END OF THE MISSION 
This scenario has a limited time frame, so it will automatically 
finish at the end of the third Game Round.
If one of the players starts their Active Turn in a Retreat! 
situation, the game will end at the end of that Turn.
