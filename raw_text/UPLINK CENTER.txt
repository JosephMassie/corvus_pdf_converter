SCENARIO SPECIAL RULES 
COMMUNICATION ANTENNAS 
There are 2 Communication Antennas on the central line of the 
table. 
They are placed 12 inches from the table edges in 300/350/400 
point games, 8 inches in 200/250 point games, and 4 inches 
in 150 point games. Each Communication Antenna must 
be represented by a Transmission Antenna Token (TRANS. 
ANTENNA) or with a scenery piece of the same diameter 
(such as the Antenna of the ITS Objective Pack Alpha, the 
Communications Array by Warsenal or the Sat Station Antenna 
by Customeeple).

SHORT SKILL 
Attack, Scenario 
REQUIREMENTS 
 
►Only Specialist Troops can declare this Skill.
 
►The Specialist Troop must be in Silhouette contact with a Communication 
Antenna.
EFFECTS 
 
►Allows the Specialist Troop to make a Normal WIP Roll to Activate a 
Communication Antenna.
 
►If the roll is failed, this can be repeated as many times as necessary, each 
time spending the corresponding Short Skill and making the roll.
 
►An Activated Communication Antenna can be Activated again by the other 
player, applying the same procedure. In this situation, the Communication 
Antenna is no longer Activated by the adversary.
 
►Player A and Player B Tokens can be used to mark the Activated 
Communication Antenna. It is recommended each player uses a different 
kind of Tokens.
CONTROL A COMMUNICATION ANTENNA 
A Communication Antenna is Controlled by a player as long 
as that player is the only one with at least one Trooper (as a 
Model, not a Marker) in Silhouette contact with it. So there 
cannot be any enemy Troopers in Silhouette contact with the 
Communication Antenna. Models in a Null State cannot do either. 
TECH-COFFIN 
There is 1 Tech-Coffin placed in the center of the table. 
The Tech-Coffin must be represented by a Tech-Coffin Token or 
with a scenery piece of the same diameter (such as the Tech-
Coffin of the ITS Objective Pack Alpha, the Stasis Coffins by 
Warsenal or the Cryo Pods by Customeeple). 
CONTROL THE TECH-COFFIN 
The Tech-Coffin is Controlled by a player as long as that player 
is the only one with at least one Trooper (as a Model, not a 
Marker) in Silhouette contact with it. So there cannot be any 
enemy Troopers in Silhouette contact with the Tech-Coffin. 
Models in a Null State cannot do either. 
SPECIALIST TROOPS 
For the purposes of this scenario, only Hackers, Doctors, 
Engineers, Forward Observers, Paramedics, and Troopers 
possessing the Chain of Command or the Specialist Operative 
Special Skill are considered Specialist Troops.
Hackers, Doctors, and Engineers cannot make use of Repeaters 
or Peripheral (Servant) Models to perform tasks reserved for 
Specialist Troops.

OPERATIONAL LEARNING
When a Specialist Troop performs a Skill with the Scenario 
Label that requires a WIP Roll and fails, they benefit from the 
following MODs in subsequent Orders:
In the second consecutive Order, the Trooper applies a +3 MOD 
to the WIP Roll required for that Scenario Skill.
In the third consecutive Order—and subsequent Orders—the 
Trooper applies +3 and +1SD MODs to the WIP Roll required for 
that Scenario Skill.
These MODs are cumulative with any other MOD that applies to 
Skills with the Scenario Label. 
IMPORTANT:
These MODs only apply to Rolls made in consecutive 
Orders by the same Trooper for the same Scenario Skill, 
with the same target, with no interruptions, or Orders spent 
on other Troopers:
If the Trooper passes the Roll, the sequence resets.
If the Trooper do not declare that Scenario Skill, the 
sequence resets. 
If the Trooper declares the same Skill, but with a different 
target, the sequence resets. 
If an Order is spent on any other Trooper, the sequence 
resets.
Only one sequence can be applied per Trooper and per 
Scenario-Labelled Skill at a time.
ACTIVE LIEUTENANT 
At the end of the game, a Lieutenant is Active if they are not 
in any Null state (Unconscious, Dead, Sepsitorized…), Isolated 
State, or any Immobilized State.
HVT AND CLASSIFIED DECK NOT USED 
In this scenario, the HVT Model and Secure HVT rules are not 
applied. Players will not deploy the HVT Model on the game 
table and they will not use the Classified Deck in this scenario.
END OF THE MISSION 
This scenario has a limited time frame, so it will automatically 
finish at the end of the third Game Round.
If one of the players starts their Active Turn in a Retreat! 
situation, the game will end at the end of that Turn.
