Once both players have selected a Common Classified Objective, they are revealed at the same time. At the beginning of Game Rounds two and three, any current Common Classified Objective cards that have not been accomplished by either player are discarded. The Common Classified Objective cards that have been accomplished are moved to a separate area, so that each player can keep track of which cards have been accomplished. Player A and Player B Tokens can be used to mark which player has accomplished each Common Classified Objective card. It is recommended each player uses a different kind of Token. Each player then draws two cards from their Classified Deck, chooses one as a Common Classified Objective, and discards the other. Any Common Classified Objective that is checked “at the end of the game” or “during the game” can be accomplished at the end of any Player Turn. If both players accomplished the same Common Classified Objective in the same Round, both players have accomplished it. A Common Classified Objective can only be accomplished after it has been drawn.
