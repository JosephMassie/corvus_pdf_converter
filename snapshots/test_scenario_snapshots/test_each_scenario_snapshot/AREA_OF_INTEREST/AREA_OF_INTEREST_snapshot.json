INTELCOM CARD (SUPPORT AND CONTROL) Before the beginning of the game, but after choosing the first Classified Objective, the player must inform to their adversary if that card will be their Classified Objective or their INTELCOM Card. Each player rolls a die and the one who gets the highest score must be the first who announces their decision to their adversary. The content of the card, whether the mission or the card numeric value, is Private Information, no matter which use the player has chosen for it. At the end of the last Game Round, when the players count up their points and in Initiative order, the player can use their INTELCOM Card in Support and Control Mode. Support and Control Mode: The player can add the value of the Support and Control Card to their Victory Points in the Zone of Operations (ZO) of their choice. The player must have at least one Trooper inside that ZO, in a non-Null State. END OF THE MISSION This scenario has a limited time frame, so it will automatically finish at the end of the third Game Round.
