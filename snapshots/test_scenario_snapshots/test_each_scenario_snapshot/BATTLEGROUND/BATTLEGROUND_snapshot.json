At the end of the Deployment Phase, in Initiative order, players must declare which Trooper from their Army List is their Key Ops. The Trooper chosen must be always one of the models deployed on the game table. Players are not allowed to choose Troopers in Hidden Deployment or in Marker state. This Trooper must always be on the game table as a Model and not as a Marker (Camouflaged, Holoecho…). Also, Irregular Troops and those whose Troop Type is REM or VH are not eligible to be Key Ops. The Key Ops possesses the Dodge (+3) and Tactical Awareness Special Skills, even if those are not listed on their Unit Profile. These Special Skills are not cumulative, if the Trooper already has them, then they are not applied. The Key Ops is identified with a Player A or B Marker.",
