The Civilians cannot be placed on top of or inside of any Scenery Item or Building, always deploying them in accessible locations on the table. Scenery placement must facilitate this. Players can use any Model from the Infinity or the Infinity Bootleg range, preferably those designated as HVT or as a Civilian. Good examples of this are the O-12 High Commissioner, the Tohaa Diplomat, Go-Go Marlene, the Fusilier Angus, the TAG Pilots, the VIP Executive or the HAZMAT A1 Specialist.
