In the third consecutive Order—and subsequent Orders—the Trooper applies +3 and +1SD MODs to the WIP Roll required for that Scenario Skill. These MODs are cumulative with any other MOD that applies to Skills with the Scenario Label. IMPORTANT: These MODs only apply to Rolls made in consecutive Orders by the same Trooper for the same Scenario Skill, with the same target, with no interruptions, or Orders spent on other Troopers: If the Trooper passes the Roll, the sequence resets. If the Trooper do not declare that Scenario Skill, the sequence resets. If the Trooper declares the same Skill, but with a different target, the sequence resets. If an Order is spent on any other Trooper, the sequence resets. Only one sequence can be applied per Trooper and per Scenario-Labelled Skill at a time.",
